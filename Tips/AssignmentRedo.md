# Grading Quirks

Here I list various quirks regarding how I grade assignments.

## Unofficial Grading Policy

Take what follows with a bit of levity. It is half fantasy and half real.

I am a **very** liberal grader. If you turn something in that vaguely resembles what I requested, I almost always give you significant credit for it. Here is an unofficial, at times tongue-in-cheek, guide to the way grading often goes for me:

*   **96-100: **More or less on time and correct
*   **92-95**: Close but either a few days late or with an obvious bug.
*   **85-91:** A few days to two weeks late, or with a number of pretty bad bugs
*   **80-84:** Two weeks to a month late, and with numerous bugs but an obvious effort to get to the correct answer
*   **60-79:** Over a month late and pretty much a disaster, but I can see that some kind of effort was made to complete the assignment. At worst, you made the effort to type a few lines of code, pushed your work, and clicked the submit button.
*   **5:** Resubmit required.
*   **0**: You never turned in anything.

I have, on rare occasions, given a student a grade between 5 and 59, but as a rule, there is a precipitous drop from a bad grade to a zero grade when you don't turn in anything. The point is that turning in almost anything is better than not turning in anything. Why? How can I justify this? I'm just looking for a pulse. Employers don't want employees who won't show a consistent effort to perform.

Please forgive my use of humor at points in the above. Remember: this is an unofficial guide. I do deviate from it significantly at times.

My sincere apologies to students who either:

*   Made an honest mistake signing up for a course that was not right for them. (Though if you read the above carefully, you can see that I do try to give you a path to success of a kind. Also, I believe that some students simply need more experience. They can succeed, it is just going to take time.)
*   Genuinely encounter a health issue or some family or personal tragedy. I know this can happen, and I try to help in those cases, though I don't accept such claims easily: I'm of Puritan stock and tend to admire a strong work ethic that is unbowed by adversity. Still, I'm not made of stone, I understand that life can get in our way at times.

## Workflow

My workflow is usually like this:

- Go to your repository
- git pull
- checkout branch if specified
- navigate to project directory
- Examine your work

So usually, these days, the most useful information is branch and folder. But if the link you provide points to branch and folder in the cloud, then that works too.

In general, just saying you are done with the assignment works, but details can be helpful, particularly if you did not do your work in the expected folder and branch.

## Assignment Redo

If you get a 5, or any other very low grade for an assignment, this generally means that I want you to redo the assignment. Depending a little on circumstances, you may lose a few points for having to redo the assignment, but usually not much, and in some cases I won't take anything off. There are some circumstances, of course, when I will ask for a redo and still dock you quite a bit, but those cases are rare. In general, getting a grade of 20 and a request for a redo is just a routine thing, and no cause for concern.

When you see any grade of 5 or below, you can assume that I am asking for a redo unless I specifically state otherwise. Please read my comments  on the assignment before letting your emotions creep into the issue. Assume all is well unless you read my comments and specifically see that I really intend to give you such a low score as a final grade. I very rarely give out very low scores as a final grade. Zeroes, of course, for missing assignments, but not fives, tens or twenties.

Just to be clear, I give out these grades frequently, so if you find you got a 5 on an assignment, don't panic or feel that you are being singled out. I'm simply saying: "Look, there was some kind of misunderstanding or carelessness here, let's just try again."

## You Must Resubmit the Assignment {#resubmit}

Let me try to explain a bit more about why I do things this way. I need a way to mark that I have processed an assignment. Given the way Canvas works, the best way to do that is to give the assignment a grade. If I want a redo, then I give you a low grade, and Canvas stops bugging me to grade the assignment. My part of the job is done for now. Now the ball is in the student's court. It is up to them to redo the assignment. When they resubmit it, then it will appear on my to-do list again, and I can go back and regrade it. The low grade is designed to motivate the student to complete the redo, but it is not meant to scare anyone, or to single any one out for unfair treatment.

Remember that I will probably not know that you have redone the assignment unless you press the submit button. That is the signal to notify me that you have completed the redo or have some message that you want me to read in regard to the assignment. Be sure to append your message to the comment area of the assignment itself. Don't try to communicate to me private information about a particular assignment through any other mechanism. All public communications about an assignment go in the discussion area.

As far as dates are concerned: If I'm going to get fussy about dates, I'll look at the dates in Git. I often don't pay excessive attention to the submission dates in Canvas if I can look up the real submission dates in Git. I don't ignore Canvas dates, but they are not the final arbiter. It's Git that knows how to tell me exactly when you turned in what. It's not that Canvas is buggy in this regard, only that it is not as precise or detailed as Git.


## Nested Folders

I don't like it when students needlessly nest folders. Suppose I ask for an assignment to be turned in in the **Week05-Foo** folder. For various reasons, students sometimes do this:

    \Src\Git\prog200-lastname\Week05-Foo\Week05-Foo

Don't do that. It will cost you up to 3 points.
