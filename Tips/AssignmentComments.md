I find that I sometimes don't reply in depth to assignments of very high quality. If I give someone a 100 or a grade in the high nineties, that is generally just a way of saying they are doing everything right.

Ideally, I should go through even the best assignments very carefully and show ways they could be improved. During some quarters, unfortunately, I find that nearly impossible. My justification in such cases, which I think is at least partially valid, is that I work overtime in some quarters to understand important new developments in our technology. That can take away from grading time.

Just coming up with a solution for students that works is not good enough. I have to come up with a solution that reflects, to some reasonable degree, at least the following best practices:

- Loose Coupling
- Unit Testing and Test Driven Development
- The Single Responsibility Principle
- The Open Closed Principle
- The Interface Segregation Principle and/or the Law of Demeter

That takes time. For me, at least, it takes a lot of time.

There are three things that I prioritize:

- Teaching the right material in the right way
- Writing clear, easy to understand assignments
- Giving in-depth, useful feedback to assignments

In the worst case scenarios, a lot of my clock cycles go into number one, number two is spotty at best, and number three is focused most on people who really needed the help at the expense of those who are doing high-quality work. If I teach people the wrong material, or teach them the right material but encourage bad practices, then I am damaging both the student's future academic career and their ability to get a good job. If my assignments need clarification, and my feedback to the best student's is spotty, I'm causing temporary pain that will be forgotten long after the benefits of knowing the right material and the right way to approach it has born fruit.

Of course, in many quarters I'm not wrestling with new technology, and I can focus my attention on two and three. Those are happier times but they are not a constant.
