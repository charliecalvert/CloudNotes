## Overview

I'll continually be referring you to various online resources. Quite often in the assignments, I provide hyperlinks to pages.

Here is a link to the Week01 page (Links to an external site.).

Inside it notice the link to the React page on Elvenware (Links to an external site.).

Notice, for instance, that one of those links on the Elvenware page leads to this page (Links to an external site.). Perhaps I should make reading that page mandatory, but I think that would be a bit too much. You should, however, at least follow all of the links in each assignment, and get a grasp of the content available. Skim through at least part of it.

The point is that we don't always read something like the docs for create-react-app (Links to an external site.) word for word, but we should know they exist, and we should know how to use them as a resource.

I will talk more about books in class today.

## Lynda

Bellevue College students (and KCLS members) get free access to **Lynda.com**.

When you sign-in, select **Sign in with my organization portal.** Then they want <b>bellevuecollege.edu</b>. They take you to the regular BC sign-in portal, and then you are in to Lynda.com.
