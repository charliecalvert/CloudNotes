##  24X7 Books

Many technical books are available through the library media center. Some are on a resource called called Books 24 X 7, others are available via other resources. They can be an excellent learning tool.

To access the books:

- Go to [My BC][MyBcc] and log in.
- Go to the [Bellevue College Library Media Center](https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/lmc/)
- Search on a topic or book name. For instance, search on **Node Express**.
- Click the links to go to the book and start reading.

Below I provide some links that may or may not be useful. Complete the steps outlined above before trying to use them. In other words, confirm that you can access a book, any book, on 24X7. If all that works, you should be able to click the links below and be taken directly to the individual books.
