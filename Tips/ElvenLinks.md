# Overview

Here are some tips on finding important information.

When I started out in the computer industry, I was Tech Support for Pascal developers at Borland. I quickly learned that one of the best tools I had was being able to quickly and easily get to the documents and examples that helped me answer questions. In that spirit, you should find ways to point to our assignments and other resources that help you write code. For instance, you should know how find information describing how to correctly:

- Declare a React class
- Create **webpack.config.js** file
- Add (npm install XXX) the packages you need to add support for React development with Babel and WebPack.

You have to come up with a series of links and easily located files that lead you to the information you need. It should not be a big struggle for you to add WebPack or React to a project. You should be able to reach the resources you need very quickly.

One of the best resources, of course, is working code. But you should also be able to load key assignments like **ReactBasics** and **RestBasics** almost instantly. Take the time to set up system that works so you can find these files instantly. Sign into Chrome or Firefox so your links are available on all the machines you use. Put example code in a repository so you can quickly clone it when you need it.

## Links

I tend to publish a lot of links in assignments and in overview documents. It is generally not necessary to read all the content referenced by these links, however  it is usually a good idea to click on most of these links and at least scan the first few paragraphs, just to make sure you understanding what information is available.

Some of these links go to very long, and often not particularly well organized, documents. Nevertheless, it is nice to at least know that there is an [Elvenware][elvenware] section that discusses [Git][elf-git], and to note that it consists of documents which in their turn link to other valuable resources.

We don't have a book, so you have no reading to do each week. But that doesn't mean you are completely off the hook in terms of doing a little reading outside of class. I'm not saying you should dedicate five or six hours to trying to read everything I link to, but dedicating 20 or 30 minutes to exploring some of the links is likely to be valuable.

For instance, every once in awhile, around week five or six, in the discussion area, someone will suddenly discover the Git book. "'Look what I found', they say. 'A free online book about git.'" But if they had spent two minutes with the Git page on Elvenware, they would have known about the book from week one.

This is far from a perfect system, and you are not graded on the number of links you explore. But I do put them there in the hopes that they will help you succeed.

## Code

Code looks like this:

```javascript
function qux() {
  console.log('bar');
}
```
