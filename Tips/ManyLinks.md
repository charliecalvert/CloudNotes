## Lots of Links

I tend to publish a lot of links in assignments and in overview documents. It is generally not necessary to read all the content referenced by these links, however  it is usually a good idea to click on most of these links and at least scan the first few paragraphs, just to make sure you understanding what information is available.

A rather extreme case is the Week01 overview:
Week01 (Links to an external site.)

At the very top, it links to the Isit320 Resources page:
Isit320 Resources (Links to an external site.)

Some of these links go to very long, and often not particularly well organized, documents. Nevertheless, it is nice to at least know that there is an Elvenware page that discusses Git, and to note that it links to other valuable resources.

We don't have a book, so you have no reading to do each week. But that doesn't mean you are completely off the hook in terms of doing a little reading outside of class. I'm not saying you should dedicate five or six hours to trying to read everything I link to, but dedicating 20 or 30 minutes to exploring some of the links is likely to be valuable.

For instance, every once in a while, around week five or six, in the discussion area, someone will suddenly discover the Git book. "'Look what I found', they say. 'A free online book about git.'" But if they had spent two minutes with the Git page on Elvenware, they would have known about the book from week one.

This is far from a perfect system, and you are not graded on the number of links you explore. But I do put them there in the hopes that they will help you succeed.

## Assignment Pace

Sometimes we seem to move slowly, but we have to have certain foundational concepts before working on a bigger project:

    Git
        Branches
    NPM
        Creating our own or working on one we fork
        Consuming popular third party libraries like express, react and babel
    Routing
        Calling with fetch
        Creating routes with express (router.get('/', function(req, res) {...});
    Debugging with the Chrome developer tools
    React
        Create from scratch (ReactBasics)
        Create with create-react-app (RestBasics (Links to an external site.))
        Integrate React into an existing jQuery based app

And so on.

I think it is sometimes easiest to learn or review concepts in smaller projects. Then, once they start to make sense, move on to bigger projects like WebCrafts. It is hard, particularly for beginners, to see how to work with and debug big projects.
