## Overview

- Move all your content to the cloud.
- Find good hardware. Either buy a good laptop/PC or learn to develop on the cloud.
- Be Sure you have a good internet connection

## Cloud Computing

If you have not done so already, it is time for you to **move nearly all your documents and code into the cloud**. We generally access information on multiple machines, from desktops to laptops to mobile devices. If we want access to our information from all our devices, then it is usually simplest to store it in the cloud.

You should also know how to use online resources to solve problems. If you want to work with computers, then it is likely that nearly every day you will encounter problems for which there is no obvious solutions. As a result, you have to **learn how to use search engines and discussion areas** to find the answer to unexpected problems. There will be many unexpected problems.

## Tools and Access to the Internet

Having good access to the Internet is an important part of this course. You will find that access to the Internet is dependent on two things:

- A good connection
- A properly configured machine
-
To an unusually large degree, this course requires that students have reliable access to the Internet. If you do not have a good connection at home, you should expect to have to spend time on the school computers, or at some other site where you can get reliable access to a computer.

Having a good connection is not enough. You also need a properly configured machine. In many, perhaps most, cases, the only way to reliably repair a poorly configured machine is to reinstall the OS. As we enter a new age of online computing, you should consider moving all your data to the cloud so that you can easily reformat the drives on your home machine when needed. On desktop machines, you should consider installing two physical drives, one for data, and one for your OS. Finally, you should consider renting a virtual machine in the cloud, and doing most of your work there.

You will also need access to a good code editor. We will work mostly with Eclipse and Geany. As much as possible, I will try to rely on Eclipse, as it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. We might also experiment with online, cloud based IDEs. On Windows, an excellent tool that you should be familiar with is NotePad++.
