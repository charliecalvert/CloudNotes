## Overview

In this document I will try to give some guidelines on ways that students can work together.

## Giving Help vs Giving Answers {#verbal-typewriter}

I encourage students to help one another understand problems. But if you feel like a request for help has become a request to simply do all or part of an assignment for another student, then you have not only a right to say no but at least a soft obligation to say no.

There is nothing wrong with pointing at a word and saying "there is a typo here: it's spelled function, not funktion." That kind of thing is fine. But if a student asks for help, and you say "the solution is to create a function that returns the result of adding its two parameters" and they look at you blankly, clearly at a loss, then that might be a warning sign. If you find the only solution is to say something like "write the word **function**, now write the word **add**, now write an open parenthesis, etc..." then that is going too far. _If you are clearly doing their work for them rather than helping them to understand a concept, then it is time to end the session._  Don't do the assignment for them, just explain what needs to be done, and let them do it.

Here is another way to look at it. All is well if a student says something like this after you explain something to them: "Oh gosh, now I see. I can finish this." And all is certainly well if they say: "Oh silly me, how could I have missed that? Thanks for the help. I've got it from here." But if you find yourself becoming a verbal typewriter, telling them exactly what to type and where to type it, then something is wrong. They are asking you to cross a line. They want you not just to help them to  understand a problem, but to do their homework for them.

I want to add a note saying that these are gentle recommendations. When one student is willing to help another, that is a commendable act. I don't want to put pressure on good people who are helping others and in doing so frequently increasing their own understanding. All that is good and something that I encourage. But sometimes it is hard for a student to say "No, this has gone far enough. I don't feel comfortable giving you that kind of help." So now you have an "official document" explaining that your teacher has defined when giving help to another student crosses a line into doing their homework for them.

## Summary

If you can give tips and then watch the other student fill in the details, then that is good. But if you are simply a verbal typewriter dictating what they should type, then that is nearly always a sign that you are being asked to do too much.
