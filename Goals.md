The most important thing I hear is that you liked working on Codecademy. I have my students work up there, and the good ones always get it done and even enjoy it a bit, and the less talented or experienced students always complain and struggle. The point is this: If you like to write code, and have any talent (and I'm sure you do) then you will get good at writing code. One has to have that spark, that love of writing code. If it is a bit game-like to you, if it is a series of fun challenges for you, then you will get good at it. That was what I was talking about when I went into the manager vs developer thing: "Are you sure you really like to write code?" If you enjoy doing it, then you can become a developer. Or a manager. Either way. But you have to enjoy it. By enjoy it, I mean enjoy writing code for hours on end.
I don't see any harm in going to any job interview. If the company is any good at all, they should be able to sort out your abilities fairly easy. Let them decide if they want you. During the interview, be as honest as you can, and listen and learn from the interview. If nothing else, get them to tell you exactly what they are looking for, and then add the best parts of that to your skill set. If the interview starts to go south, I don't see any harm in asking: "What can I do so the next time you will hire me? What are you looking for, in what areas do you think I need work?" Every once in a while an interviewer will actually get abusive, but most of the time, the worst that happens is that they don't invite you back for a second chance. I'm not sure that outcome even burns your chances at that company. They should be impressed, rather than negative, if you come back six months later, or a year later, and say: I've been studying a lot and would like to try again". 
What they are asking for here makes sense to me. This is more or less what I try to teach my students. In particular, I think you should learn all you can about:
JavaScript. In particular, callbacks, functions, objects, etc.
jQuery and querying the DOM
jQuery and ajax calls
Jasmine and unit testing
Javascript on the server side with nodejs (or python on the server)
Git
The last subject is a topic all its own. Do you have an account on GitHub? If not, you should start one. If you don't know how, let me know, and I can help you get started.
Another thing to learn are the developer tools on Chrome or Firefox. I like them both, but I would go with Chrome first.
I can't remember if I've told you this story before, but I had a student from China who was in desperate straits. She was broke, and feared she would have to go back to China with her tail between her legs, and really, really didn't want to do that for what I think are good reasons. (Her home town in China was remote, impoverished, etc.) The first interviews she went to here in the US all ended in failure. I won't sugar coat it. She was a tough woman, and yet she was practically in tears after those interviews. (She had no green card, no visa, so her task was very difficult.) But she kept going back, kept learning from each interview. She became the interview ninja. Now she has a good job at Microsoft. And, despite her struggle, she is both smart and a bit arrogant, and now her complaint is that her job doesn't challenge her! Kind of a comic state of affairs if you know her whole history. I'm not worried about her, she'll get a better job over time.

Have you done the jquery course on Codecademy? If not, I would do that right away. It is reasonably good, but:
The most important part of jquery is not the ability to create animations in your HTML, 
but the ability to write selectors that let you perform operations on particular HTML nodes. 
Find a paragraph with a particular ID and put or get text on it.
Change the style of all H2 elements, or all H2 elements assigned a particular class
Add LIs  to UL element using jquery
Etc
The next thing you want to get really good at it is using functions like jQuery.getJSON or jQuery.ajax. To really start learning about them, you need to write at least a little server side code, probably with NodeJs and Express.

There are many different skills to learn on the server side: node, python, ruby even (despite what you hear), PHP. It's all good. I just think it makes sense to learn node because it is:
Popular right now
Allows you to do JavaScript on the server and client
But learning all you can about jquery and selectors is a good place to start.

If I'm talking about stuff you already know, just tell me. If you want more info, I can probably help.
