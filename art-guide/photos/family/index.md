Left: This picture is of Aunt Clara and her son Charles and my
[Mom](../1958_08_19_Mom/Mom.html) sitting on a fence. It was probably
taken in 1933 or 1934. Thank you to Janet Fishburn for providing this
information. Right: My [Mom](../1958_08_19_Mom/Mom.html) perhaps in the
back yard (the Lafayette side) at 40 Southgate?

This is very likely the front porch at 40 Southgate and two girls,
possibly King sisters. Ann Gilbert could be the taller of the two
standing at what could be Granddaddy's dock at Knobby Lodge on [Harness
Creek?](http://bit.ly/qYrPSZ)
