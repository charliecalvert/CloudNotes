===

Vice Admiral James Francis Calvert was born in Cleveland, Ohio on Sept
8, 1920 and died June 3, 2009. He attended Berlin Heights High School,
where he was President of his class. Originally in school at Oberlin,
planning to be a doctor, for financial reasons he changed course and
applied to the Naval Academy. He was turned down in 1938 and accepted in
1939.

A member of the Naval Academy class of 1943, he was graduated 105th out
of 650. His class was sent out a year early because of the war, so his
actual graduation date was June 19, 1942. He must have married
[Mom](../1958_08_19_Mom/Mom.html) around the same time.

Dad served on a number of submarines. During World War II he served on
the the Jack, and received command of the Haddo. These subs were
credited with sinking 15 Japanese ships over the course of nine combat
patrols. After the way he was on the Chard, Harder, Trigger and the
Skate. He was in the Haddo at Tokyo bay for the Japanese surrender on
Sept 2, 1945.

On Feb 17, 1959, he Captained the first Submarine to surface at the
North Pole.

In the sixties, he was head of the Europe and NATO Branch of
Politico-Military Policy Division. By July 2, 1965, he was a Rear
Admiral.

According to an article in the Annapolis Evening Capital, James Calvert
was announced as the new Superintendent of the Naval Academy on Friday,
May 3, 1968. He served there until 1972, and then took charge of the
First Fleet in the Pacific. He retired from the Navy in 1973.

In 1968, Dad married Peggy Harrison Battle at the [St Andrews
Interdenominational
Church](http://www.standrewsgreece.com/Site/Welcome.html) in Athens,
Greece.

Dad won the Silver and Gold Star and the Legion of Merit four times, the
last three receiving Gold stars in its stead.
