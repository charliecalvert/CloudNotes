## Overview-TEST

I'm an adjunct professor at Bellevue College. I've been working with computers and writing code in one form or another for about 25 years. I started out with Turbo Pascal and Delphi, spent time with Java, C++, Python and Perl, and then spent a number of years working in C#.

I enjoy hiking, snow-shoeing, swimming, reading and watching movies. I also like to write. I'm known in the computer world primarily as a book author:
