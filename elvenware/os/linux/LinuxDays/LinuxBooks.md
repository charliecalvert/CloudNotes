<h1>Linux Books</h1>

  <p>To get started, you need books. If you are lucky, you can learn a lot 
from friends, and everyone can turn to the internet and newsgroups for 
information. Books don't necessarily have better information than you 
get from the Internet or from friends, but it is often presented in a more 
carefully thought out, and more logical, manner.</p>

<P>Before getting started, I should mention the Linux Journal, a fine 
magazine that no serious Linux user should be without. It has lots of 
good information, and is fun to read.</P>

  <h2>Basic Must Have Books for Getting Started</h2>

  <ul>
    <li CLASS="big"><b>A Practical Guide to Linux</b>, by Mark G. Sobell, Addison Weseley 
    Publisher. This is the one essential book that no new comer can do without.</li>
    <li CLASS="big"><b>Running Linux</b>, Matt Welsh, O'Reilly. This is the other "essential" book
    for new comers. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Digging a Little Deeper</h2>
  
  <ul>
  <li CLASS="big"><b>Using Caldera Open Linux</b>, Allan Smart, Que Books: Though the titular 
    purpose of the book is Caldera Linux, this huge book contains a number of very 
    thorough introductions to important KDE and command line based Linux tools. A 
    very useful book. Once you have absorbed <b>A Practical Guide to Linux</b> and/or
    <b>Running Linux</b>, this is a good next step for those who want more information.</li>
    <li CLASS="big"><b>Linux Unleashed</b>, Tim Parker, Sams Publishing: Similar to Using 
    Caldera Open Linux, this book provides a good overview of the Linux, its 
    utilities, and its administration. I found it not quite as well written or 
    thorough as <b>Using Caldera Linux</b>, but still a good book.</li>
      <li CLASS="big"><b>Linux Administration, A Beginners Guide</b>, Steve Shah, Osborne. Info
    on networking utilities, etc. 
    <li CLASS="big"><b>Maximum Linux Security</b>, Anonymous, Sams. An okay overview of knotty 
    Linux security issues. Not a great book, but it gets the job done.</li>
  
  </ul>  
    
  <h2>Programmer's Books</h2>
  <ul>
    <li CLASS="big"><b>Linux Programmers Reference</b>, Richard Peterson, Osborne. A good quick 
    reference for programmers.</li>

    <li CLASS="big"><b>Linux Programming Bible</b>, John Goerzen, IDG books. A basic 
    introduction to a suite of Linux Programming Tools</li>

    <li CLASS="big"><b>Linux Programming Unleashed</b>, by Kurt Wall, Sams Books. The same
    sort of thing as the Linux Programming Bible.</li>
    
    <li CLASS="big"><b>Linux Kernel Book</b>. I have not read much of this one, but it had a lot
    of detailed information about deep programming issues. A guru's book.</li>
    
    <li CLASS="big"><b>GNU C++ for Linux</b>, Tom Swan, Que Books. A port of his classic 
    introductino to C++ books to Linux. The end of the book provides some good 
    chapters on programming the X Window Library.</li>
  </ul>
