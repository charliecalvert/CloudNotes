<H1>The Kylix Webinar</H1>
<P><I>by Charlie Calvert</I></P>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">[DUNCAN: This text includes both an intro to
Kylix and an overview of the Webinar. You can use both sections if
you want, or only the Kylix Webinar section. The overview of the
Webinar is a separate file coming later. I will cut the Kylix Webinar
section down in that file.]</FONT></P>
<P>The Kylix Webinar is an interactive seminar on the web that
features an introduction to Borland Object Pascal Development on
Linux systems. Attendees at the Webinar will learn the techniques
involved in using Kylix to develop applications and libraries for
Linux.</P>
<H2>What is Kylix</H2>
<P>The Kylix project is a port of two Borland compilers called Delphi
and C++Builder to Linux. Developers who use either the Object Pascal
or C++ versions of Kylix will be able to create native Linux
applications that run under any complete Linux distribution and which
support both KDE and GNOME. 
</P>
<P>A cross-platform object-oriented library called CLX (pronounced
clicks) lies at the heart of Kylix. CLX consists of several parts.
The core of the CLX library provides the developer with a set of
components such as edit controls, list boxes and scroll bars. Other
key parts of the CLX library consist of database and web development
components, as well as access to the underlying operating system. Any
CLX based application can be compiled to run natively on either Linux
or Windows.</P>
<H2>The Kylix Webinar</H2>
<P>The Kylix Webinar is designed to introduce developers from any
background to all the major features of Object Pascal development on
the Linux platform. Subjects covered include an overview of the IDE,
an overview of CLX, and various advanced features.</P>
<P>Major sections of the Kylix Webinar will include a thorough
introduction to the Kylix IDE, debugger and suite of wizards.
Subjects covered include:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Project Management</B>. The creation of applications, as
	well as management of complex suites of applications. Development of
	command line based applications will also be covered.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Debugging</B>: Using or managing watches and breakpoints.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Wizards</B>: Use wizards to help you add features to your
	applications.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Other Tools</B>: Learn how to use the Help system,
	customize the editor and utilize other tools found in the IDE.</P>
</UL>
<P>The Kylix Webinar will show developers how to use CLX both in
code, and in the visual development environment. The talk will
include brief descriptions of how to:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Create CLX Applications using
	Kylix RAD based drag and drop technology</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Develop custom Kylix components 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Interface with the Linux OS 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Use the RAD tools to develop
	database applications</P>
	<LI><P>Create Apache based web applications and libraries 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The discussion will include an overview of the CLX architecture.
Developers will see which tools are kept in which files, and how the
CLX library is structured.</P>
<P>Experienced Delphi developers will learn about the differences
between CLX and the VCL, and receive tips on porting their
applications from Windows to Linux. 
</P>
<P>Viewers of the webinar will be given a  look at some of the deeper
features of the Kylix compiler. Subjects of interest to these
developers that will be touched on in this talk include introductions
to Kylix's:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Full implemenation OOP 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Support for both pointers and
	interfaces. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Support for shared objects (called
	DLLs in Windows) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Support for the X Window Library 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Graphics programming model</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Access to the Libc suite of
	functions, and other libraries frequently used by GCC developers</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>The Kylix Webinar provides developers with an overview of Kylix.
It shows how this powerful compiler and IDE can be used to develop
applications or libraries for Linux.
