People Centered
===============

I like to wax philosophical. I think it there is value to thinking on the
meta level, to understanding our goals and the reasons we have for setting
those goals. 

This chapter is dedicated to those matters. Hopefully I will soon turn all 
this into a video or MP3 so that you can download it and watch it, or listen 
to it while driving in your car.

Users
-----

Most mobile devices are easy to use – at least in principle. Nearly
anyone can pick up a mobile phone and make a phone call or play a song.

It is, however, surprisingly difficult for even expert computer users to
understand how to use the full potential of a small device like a phone,
tablet, or MP3 player. Many will find the journey from neophyte to
expert longer than expected.

There are as many different approaches to using small devices as there
are users. However, I focus on three types of users:

-   Those who grew up with phones and MP3 players.
-   Experienced computer users who know PCs and laptops but not mobile
    devices.
-   Developers and techies who want to develop applications for small
    devices.

Young people often have full access to a computer for the first time
when they are given a phone or MP3 player. Everything comes together for
them at one time:

-   The family PC may be supervised, but no one supervises them when
    they use a phone.
-   The family PC may be shared, but their phone is their own.
-   They can take mobile devices to school, the back yard, or to the
    library.

As a result, young people pour a good deal of their not inconsiderable
passion and intelligence into learning how to use their device, and
finding ways to stretch its capacity.

We sometimes think the developers of Twitter or Facebook were geniuses
for seeing the potential of those media. Yet in many ways, the real
geniuses were the young users who kept pushing the limits of the
software, and who kept demanding new features that fulfilled their
needs, their dreams and their imagination.

While the young adopted devices quickly and passionately, older computer
users found themselves in a very different position:

-   Why should they learn to write email, browse the web, or read
    documents on a phone? They could already do those things on a
    computer.
-   Small screens, lack of ports, and input devices made mobile devices
    appear inferior to PCs. They could see the drawbacks easily enough,
    but it was hard for them to recognize the strengths.

Beginner’s Mind {#beginner’sMind}
---------------

To master a small device like an iPhone, Android tablet or Windows Phone
takes work. Getting good at using Mobile Devices requires serious
effort, and real study.

Perhaps it might help if we begin to by just dropping the word phone
altogether. Most people don't use cell phones for making phone calls.
They use them for communication, but not for making phone calls. In
fact, phone calls are not even second, or in many cases even third in
line for the most common activity for most users of Androids and cell
phones. Therefore, it is best if we stop calling them phones, and start
thinking of them as mobile devices, or better yet, mobile computers.

Anyone over 30 years of age probably once owned a computer that is not
nearly as powerful as a modern cell phone. A modern mobile device such
as Android Phone is not just technically a computer, it is actually a
very powerful computer with a sophisticated screen, plenty of memory,
and extraordinary capacity to access the internet in general, and the
cloud in particular.

Mobile devices are not just small computers; they are a new kind of
tool. A mobile device is an evolutionary development as different from a
computer as an airplane is different from a car or train. Airplanes did
not replace cars, and mobile devices will not replace PCs. Nevertheless,
thinking that one who is good at using a PC is therefore automatically
good at using a mobile device is a fundamental error, just as it is an
error to assume that because one can drive a car one can pilot an
airplane or a be a conductor on a train.

We should approach the mobile world with what Zen teachers call a
beginner's mind. Assume nothing. Assume most of what you know is more of
an impediment than an asset. Yes, you are an expert at using Microsoft
Outlook to handle a Microsoft Exchange Account. That does not mean,
however, that you know how to handle email on a phone. Sure you an
expert at using Chrome to browse the web; that does not mean, however,
that you know how to browse the web with a mobile device. Expertise with
Microsoft Word can be as much a hindrance as an advantage when using
mobile devices to create documents.

When we first used computers, many of us spent hours simply playing with
them. Over the years, we have changed that attitude, and we now try to
remain focused when we open our computers. We read email, write
articles, debug code, read and grade assignments. My suggestion is that
for a time we drop that directed approach, and simply set time aside to
play with our mobile devices. Can we master the phone? How much can you
find out about your devices’ camera? Can you easily transfer the
pictures you take to the cloud and show to friends?

Dig into the tools you find. You don't know what Google or Amazon have
to offer until you go look.
