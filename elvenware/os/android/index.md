Android - Introduction
=======

This section of the Elvenware site is focused on Android from the end user's 
perspective. If you are interested primarily in Android development, go here:

- [Android with Java](/charlie/development/android/index.html)
- [Cordova/PhoneGap](/charlie/development/android/PhoneGap.html)

To learn the Android Phone or Tablet OS, there are two broad subjects you 
need to understand:

-   The unique hardware found on a Android device. For instance, a typical 
	Android device has a phone and GPS. These are not features found on most 
	PCs PC
-   Cloud computing. if you store information on a phone, then you can't
    reach it while you are on a PC. If you store information on your PC,
    then you can't reach it while you are on a phone. This suggests that
    we need a third alternative for storing our documents, data,
    spreadsheets, databases, and other forms of information. The best,
    and only viable, option is the Cloud.

Cloud computing is such a large topic that I have covered it in its own 
section of this site, which can be found here:

[Cloud Computing](/charlie/development/cloud/index.shtml)

Additional information about mobile devices and the cloud is scattered 
throughout this section of the site. In particular, Chapter 02, [Android 
Applications](AndroidApplications.html), is much concerned with cloud 
computing. If you want to learn about the cloud in general, then follow the 
above link to the section on Cloud Computing. If you want to learn about 
accessing the cloud from a mobile device, then read the material linked in
the next section of this document.
