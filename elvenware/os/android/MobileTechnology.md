Mobile Technology
=================

In the previous chapter I gave a broad overview of mobile technology. Without
ever being specific about any one technology, I tried to give a sense of
what a mobile device is, how it fits into the broader field of computational
devices, and how it will likely impact individual users.

Wireless
--------

If you are going to connect to the cloud with a mobile device, there are
dozens of possible protocols, but in the end, you usually have only
three choices:

-   A low range Personal Area Network or connecting across short
    distances with a technology like Bluetooth.
-   A Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) carries wireless protocols a
    moderate distance using protocols such as WiFi - 802.11 g or n.
-   City wide Cellular networks (Packet Data or Roaming Data) that are
    usually called 3G or 4G. EDGE is popular 3G system, while WIMAX is a
    4G protocol.

As a rule, access to wireless protocols are free, while access to packet
data or roaming data can be obtained only if you pay money to a cellular
carrier like AT&T, Verizon or TMobile.

Cellular and Wi-Fi. {#cellularAndWiFi}
-------------------

You have undoubtedly heard a good deal of talk about 3G and 4G networks.
These are cellular networks that allow you to send data to and from a
mobile device. You can turn off your cellular network and still have
phone coverage. You need your cellular network only if:

-   You need to transfer data such as email or files
-   You are not on a Wi-Fi network.

People get very concerned about the amount of data that their contract
will allow them to transfer each month. Personally, I take the smallest
amount my company will allow. I use cellular networks to transfer data
only in rare circumstances, and when I do, I'm very careful about what I
send back and forth. In particular, I using it almost entirely for maps
and navigation.

Does this mean that I don't use data on my mobile devices? No, not at
all. I'm sure I transfer a respectable, even unusually large, amount of
data over my phone. It is just that I perform large transfers only when
I am connected to a wireless network. In particular, I transfer most of
my data either over my home network, or over the Bellevue College
Network. I have a cellular contract for my phone, but my tablet works
only over Wi-Fi. I'm content with this arrangement. I need to connect my
phone to the network to transfer data from time to time, usually because
I want navigation tools or to get email. My tablet, on the other hand,
is not a tool I often use when on the go. I am content to wait until I
am near a hotspot before I connect it to the network.

CDMA and GSM are two competing technologies for delivering cellular
content. There is no particular technical advantage to using one or the
other, but GSM is more commonly used around the world. As a result, if
your phone uses GSM, then you will be more easily able to use it in
foreign countries. There are always trade offs, but America is one of
the few countries that has this problem, because it is one of the few
places where the government has not been actively involved in setting
standards. It is also one of the few places in the industrialized world
where connectivity is spotty, and where prices are often prohibitively
high.

- CDMA: Code Division Multiple Access
- GSM: Global System for Mobiles

In the US, only ATT&T and T-Mobile use GSM. The rest use CDMA. If you
like to travel abroad, consider using a GSM phone so you will more
easily be able to connect overseas.

In general, in Europe laws were passed to make phones more easily
interchangable. In the US, companies fight to keep you locked into 
their system. In theory, the move to 4G and 4G LTE should end the
grip of the big cellular carriers on your phone, but in practice,
these companies are coming up with tricks that will keep you locked
in.

4G standards are starting to be rolled out. This fourth generation of
cellular communications is defined not by a particular technology, but
by the speed at which the technology operates. There are currently two
technologies, LTE and WiMAX, both of which are significantly faster than
3G technologies, but which do not yet reach 4G speeds of 1 GB per second
(Gbit/s). WiMAX 2 and LTE-Advanced should operate at this speed and
should be available by 2013.

![Status Network](images\Status01.png)

In the screenshow of the network status page, can you find both places
where it tells us that we are connected to 4G LTE network? Hint: Look
carefully at the status bar at the top of the screenshot.

Frankly, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about these things. Fast
Wi-Fi networks meet most of my needs, and even relatively slow 3G
networks usually allow me to get the data I need when I am on the road
and really need to pull down a map, a web page, or some email.
Nevertheless, I'm sure I will adjust quickly enough when faster transfer
rates become available -- so long as our cellular cariiers adjust rates
appropriately to handle the speeds they offer. I have seen, for
instance, cellular networks charge \$20 a MB for transfers in "foreign"
countries such as Canada or Mexico. Since some phones automatically
upload pictures as you take them, a \$10 trip over the border could
quickly lead to the loss of your house if you start shooting some
pictures or video while strolling for a few minutes on the wrong side of
the imaginary line drawn between Washington State and British Columbia!

-   LTE: Peak download of 100 Mbit/s.
-   WiMAX: Peak download of 128 Mbit/s

The upload speads for these technologies are generally one half of the
download speed.

4G LTE and WiMax
---

The acronym LTE stands for Long Term Evolution. It is based on GSM/EDGE
and UMTS. The technology first appeared in 2009 in Northern Europe, and in 2010
in the US.

Both 4G LTE and WiMax fail to fulfill the 4G specification. However,
they have officially been allowed to use the name since they do 
represent a significant improvement over 3G. We are just now starting
to hear about LTE Advanced, which might be a real 4G network. 

LTE advanced would allow uploads of 1 GBits per second.
The 4G LTE networks currently available allow 100 MBits per second. 


Cellular and Money
------------------

On many Android devices, you will have a limit to how much Cellular data you
can download. Let's be clear:

- As a rule, WiFi is free. Just connect to the network, and you can download
as much data as you want. There are some public places where you are charged
for using WiFi, but in places like your home, a school, or at work, you 
usually have free access to WiFi.
- Some Cellular accounts are unlimited. Most, hwoever, have a data limit on 
them. Know how much data you can download, and keep track of it. On some 
Android Devices, you can do this by choosing **Settings | Connections | Data 
Usage**.  A big danger is that you could begin downloading application 
updates, or begin streaming music or videos, over your cellular connection. 
As a rule, you never want to do these things.  

- In the Google Play Store, select **Settings | Auto Update Apps over Wifi 
only**. If you get a new phone, this is the first thing you should check. In 
general, when you buy a new phone, you should immediately do two things: set 
up your Google Account by going to the Play Store. In the Play Store, set up 
your account so you can only download over Wifi
- Make sure you cannot stream music over anything but WiFi. In Google Play Music,
go to **Settings | Streaming | Stream via WiFi Only**. Also check **Download via
Wi-Fi Only**.

GPS {#gPS}
---

GPS is not the same thing as 3G, 4G or WiFi. For instance, my phone will
give me accurate GPS readings even when I have data transfer (WiFi and
3G) turned off. However, you are probably used to having maps download
when you look at GPS data. Nevertheless, if you know what to do with raw
GPS (Lat/Long) data, or if you just want to record a GPS track, you
shouldn't need to turn on either WiFi or Cellular data. If you turn on
Airplane mode, however, then you will probably stop getting GPS data.

Cloud Maps {#cloudMaps}
----------

It might help to consider an example of the relationship between a
mobile device and the cloud. When we use a navigation tool to help us to
drive from one location to another, the information we use is typically
stored in the cloud. Our computers connect to servers in the cloud, pull
down a map, pull down information about streets and traffic, and plot a
route between our current position and our destination.

Almost everything we see: the image of the map itself, the information
about driving distance, the direction of one-way roads, the shortest
distance between points, descriptions of landmarks -- all of it
originates in a data store based in the cloud. It may not be a
traditional relational database, but it is nonetheless data stored in
the cloud.

It took little time for people to become attached to mapping and
navigation tools, but once they caught on, they became very popular. If
your phone could not connect to the cloud and pull down mapping down
keyed to your current location, then the phone would not be nearly as
valuable to you. We love our phones not because they are computers, but
because they are computers connected to the cloud.


Mail
----

If you have been using a computer for years, and if you are used to a
particular mail program, you have a number of hurtles to overcome before
you can begin using your phone as a mail client. Here are some thoughts
and ideas:

-   You can probably get Exchange, Gmail, Hotmail or any other mail
    service on your phone. If you think you can't, you are probably just
    missing something or using the wrong tools.
-   As a rule, you use the Email app for Exchange or POP accounts, and
    you use the Gmail app for Gmail. There are custom applications for
    other common mail carriers, such as Hotmail.

You can handle all your email communications over the phone. At first I
wondered how people did this. Do some people have smaller fingers than
me? Have they got some kind of mind meld with their phones? It turns out
that it is just a question of desire. You just need to be willing to get
good at using mail applications on a phone. You probably once put a lot
of time into learning how to use a PC. You need to do the same thing
with your phone. You may, in fact, have to be prepared to go through a
significant learning process even to perform "simple" functions such as
using a phone. It's all a matter of attitude.

One exercise that I have found helpful is to sit down in front of a
computer with my phone in my hand. Open up my mail client on both the PC
and the Phone. Try to handle all my mail on the phone. When I get stuck
or confused, I go to the PC client and try to sort out what is
happening. Perhaps I will find some kind of mail that I just can't
process on my phone - at least not yet. In that case, can I mark it for
later processing on the PC? If I have 100 messages, can I get through 93
of them on the phone, and handle the remaining seven later on the PC?

The Side by Side Strategy {#theSideBySideStrategy}
-------------------------

I believe that it is not cheating to use your phone and your PC at the
same time. At first, you may find that you did something on your phone
but you are not sure that it really worked. If you performed the
activity in the cloud, and you should be doing everything in the cloud,
then you can simply open the cloud application you used on your device
on your PC and check to make sure it worked. I often find that once I
confirm that it is working, then I'm able to go back to my phone, and
confirm the same thing on my phone.

Tablet and Phones {#tabletAndPhones}
-----------------

Which is better: a tablet or a phone? This is question that can obsess
someone new to mobile devices. There are many arguments in favor of each
platform:

-   It is easier to input data on tablet than on a phone.
-   Some kinds of documents, like technical books that contain code,
    look better on a tablet because lines are not wrapped in such
    awkward places.
-   A movie looks better on a tablet.
-   A standard book is easier to read on a tablet - for the first
    fifteen minutes. But if you want to read in bed for an hour or two,
    you might be surprised to find that you prefer a phone.
-   You can take a phone with you wherever you go. A tablet is big, and
    bulky. Unless you have a backpack, you won't want to carry it with
    you on a hike. And even if you do have a backpack, it is awkward to
    pull a tablet out just to take a photograph.
-   And of course most tablets aren't designed to be used as phones,
    though they can work very nicely as Skype clients.

Ultimately, the sad truth is that there are good reasons to own both a
tablet and a phone. They each have their uses.

But come one Charlie, you must have an opinion. Which do you really
prefer? If you had to choose, which would you take with you and which
leave behind? The answer, perhaps not surprisingly, is not easy to frame
properly:

-   There are times when a phone is much easier to carry and use than a
    tablet. There just things you can do on a phone that you really need
    to do that are hard to do with a tablet. In particular, you can
    carry the phone almost anywhere, while there are some places where a
    tablet is really awkward to use.
-   On the other hand, I really love my Android tablet in a way that I
    don't love my phone. My phone is convenient, but there are times
    when I have a real romance with my tablet. Sometimes I can get real
    work done on a tablet, or really enjoy myself browsing or playing
    games on a tablet, It can, at times, feel like exactly the right
    device. while a phone is almost always a compromise between
    convenience and necessity.

Passwords
---------

As we move into the cloud, passwords becoming ubiquitous. It is not at
all unusually for one person to maintain 25, 50, even 75 or 100 online
accounts. No one can stay on top of that many usernames and passwords.

Even if you have an exceptional memory, there will come a time when the
panoply of sites, password restrictions, and updated passwords will
surpass your ability to remember the necessary details. One site has a
limit of 12 characters, the next site doesn’t allow special characters;
another site insists that you include special characters. Some sites
force you to update your password at awkward times, other sites are so
important to you that you feel compelled to update the password. Will
you, at the same time, update all your 75 sites with a new password?
Probably not.

There are several rules you need to consider when working with
passwords:

-   Create multiple levels of passwords. Break your sites out into
    groups, and assign a different password to each group.
-   Create complex passwords that cannot be easily guessed
-   Change passwords on most sites at least once every 6 months, and
    preferably once every 3 months

Not all passwords are created equal. Suppose you choose the word
**enter** as a password. Most hackers could break that password in less
than 1/100^th^ of a second. Suppose you choose **enterT0wnN0w!** as a
password. It might take a hacker 26 million years to crack that
password. It is not difficult to learn how to create good passwords. You
just need to develop a few simple skills.

Here are some sites you can visit to help you learn how to design a
robust password:

-   [http://howsecureismypassword.net/](http://howsecureismypassword.net/)
-   [https://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/password-checker.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/password-checker.aspx)
-   [http://www.passwordmeter.com/](http://www.passwordmeter.com/)

Of course, once you have created a good password, you need to have a
system for remembering it. If you are using a mobile device, then you
need to be able to remember it not just when you are at home, but when
you are on the road. As a result, you probably want to use an online
password tool such as LastPass, 1Password, or mSecure to help you track
your passwords.

Writing information down in an encrypted document can also be helpful,
but you need to be sure you can read the document even when you are on a
remote machine. For instance, trying to read an encrypted Excel
SpreadSheet is difficult if you are at a friend’s house and have access
only to your Android phone.

Finally, it is possible that there are few sites that are so important
to you that you would not trust the password to any third party, or to
any encryption system. If you feel that way, fine, but you probably
don’t need anything like that level of security on email accounts,
technical sites, or social media accounts. Yes, you still want these
sites to be secure, but a strong, frequently updated password and an
encryption system that takes a few million years to crack is probably
going to keep even a dreaded enemy, such as an ex-girlfriend, out of
your Facebook account!

Display and Touch {#displayAndTouch}
-----------------

We depend on our ability to manipulate a mobile device through touch.
There are various types of displays that respond to touch.

-   Capacitive displays are based on the human skins ability to conduct
    electricity. For instance, they can sense if they are near anything
    that is more or less conductive than air. Devices of this type, are
    very responsive, though this can be bad in a device such as a reader
    where you don't want to turn a page by accident.
-   Resistive displays are more resistant, that is less responsive, and
    do not require that we touch it with our fingers
