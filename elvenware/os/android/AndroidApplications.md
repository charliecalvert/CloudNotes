## Android Applications {#androidApplications}


This area of Elvenware describes how to use Android. Go
[here][andapp] to learn
how to program Android.

## Apps

Though browser support on Android is constantly improving, applications are
still often the best way to access information on mobile platforms.
You can tap the App Launcher icon in the top right corner of the home
screen to bring up the **Apps Tray**. You can then swipe left or right
to page through a list of all the applications on your Android. Use the
Play Store or a similar tool to add new applications, and go to the
Application section of the Settings tool to uninstall applications. You
can use the Storage section of the Settings tool to see if you are
running out of space in which to install applications.

[![Description: Description: Description: Description: Description: The
Apps
Tray](../../development/cloud/images/AppsTray01Small.png)](../../development/cloud/images/AppsTray01.jpg)

**Figure 0X: The Apps Tray provides you with multiple screens from which
you can select the applications you want to use on your application.**

## Markets: Play Store and Amazon {#markets:PlayStoreAndAmazon}

Just as the Apple Store is a hub of life on an iPhone, the Play Store is
a central feature of life on the Android.

![Description: Description: Description: Description: Description: The
Google Play Store is a major hub on the Amazon
platform](images/PlayStore01Small.png)

**Figure 0x:The Google Play Store is a major hub on the Amazon
platform**

There is, however, serious competition from the Amazon App Store. If you
consume music or applications at all, you should probably use both
applications.

## Evernote

Evernote's primary purpose is to allow you to create and share notes between
multiple devices and multiple accounts. It contains a useful editor which
allows you to select fonts and colors, or create bold, italic and underlined
text. You also have support for bullets and tables.

The editor is the heart of Evernote, but it also supports sharing documents,
photos and audio. I like Evernote because it works well on both a PC and a
mobile device such as a phone or tablet and because it easily syncs information
between these different tools.

There is a good standalone application for using Evernote on a PC, a good Android App, and there is also a web client for us on the PC. I used to prefer the standalone
Evernote app for the PC, but now all the tools are quite good. There are also good mobile apps for iOS, and Windows Phone. When using a mobile device, you should load one of them.

Evernote Notebooks can be shared with others, and both parties and can add and edit notes.

Your personal notebooks can be either private or shared. In the
standalone PC application, you can choose **Shared | Manage Sharing** to
get an overview of which folders are shared and which are private.
Otherwise, right click on the folder and choose the option that allows
you to share or modify the share for a notebook.

In my opinion, the best strategy for learning Evernote is to search for icons and hover over them, click on them or perform both actions. Discover what they do. Don't miss any of the icons. Try clicking on them all, even the obscure (i) icon on the folder page. If you want, create two accounts, and share folders between them, or work with a fellow student and practice sharing folders and notes.

Here is are some links to key documents for learning Evernote:

- [Creaet notes](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/208314478)
- [Create Notebools](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005637)
- [Share a Notebooks](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/208314748).

When working with notes, you should see an array of editing options that include:

-   Add a check box for lists
-   Add a grid for tables
-   Attach a file
-   Add a voice note
-   Select font, font size, or font color
-   Bold, italic and underline
-   Align paragraphs right, left, center, etc
-   Add bullets or numbering
-   Add a horizontal rule to make a break between sections

You can select a word, right click, and select hyperlink to add a
hyperlink.

You can drag pictures from the Internet Explorer onto a note.

###Evernote and Bluetooth

I tried sharing a note via bluetooth. I connected using the usual
techniques, but all it did was send the URL of the note to my PC in a text
file. I then pasted the URL into a browser, and that worked. There were
actually two bluetooth options, one called Send via Blueooth, and the other
just Bluetooth. The later option seem to go more quickly, and it sent an
HTML file rather than a text file. That meant I did not have to copy and
paste the URL, I could just launch the file and click on the link. Neither
option was all that great.

SpringPad {#springPad}
---------

For awhile, it seemed as if SpringPad and Evernote were competing products.
However, that is no longer the case. SpringPad is not really about taking
notes. It is more about creating folders with information in them and then
sharing those folders with other people. If you want to create notes, use
Evernote.

Look here to see what you can do with SpringPad:

- <https://springpad.com/#!/CharlieCalvertus/wantsto/read>

All I need to do is point my camera at the bar code on the back of a book,
and it gets entered automatically into a database.

On a PC, a good way to use SpringPad is to:

-   Launch Chrome
-   Select Ctrl-T to start an empty Tab
-   Find and select the Chrome Web Store Icon
-   Install SpringPad and SpringPad extensions for Chrome

On a phone, of course, you want to install the Android or iOS SpringPad
app.

Once it is installed, you can begin adding notes and folders.

To create a folder:

-   Open SpringPad
-   Go to the MyNotebooks tab
-   Choose Add a Notebook

To open a folder

-   Open SpringPad
-   Go to the MyNotebooks tab
-   Double click an existing notebook to open it

To make a folder public

-   Open SpringPad
-   Go the the MyNotebooks tab
-   Notice that some notebooks have a red lock on them, on the right,
    near the bottom
-   Wave the mouse over this lock until a Gear appears
-   Select the gear, go to the Sharing page, choose Make it Public

To Share a note:

-   Create a public folder and open it, or open an existing public
    folder.
-   Create a note in your folder or select an existing note
-   Click the share button near the top of the page
-   Select the link icon to get a short URL that you can share with
    others.
-   Optionally, there are other options for sharing via Facebook,
    Twitter or email.

****

To create a hyperlink in a SpringPad note, proceed in much the same way
you would when adding a hyperlink in Word, or in any other application:

-   Open SpringPad
-   Go the MyNotebooks tab
-   Create a note in your folder or select an existing note
-   Click the Edit button on the top right.
-   Highlight a word and select the link icon on the toolbar. Paste in
    the URL you want to use and click OK.


**Following Notebooks**. One of the core concepts with Springpad is the idea
of following a notebook.

**Collaborating on a Notebook**. You can choose the gear to configure the
notebook, and then stop collaborating.

Google Docs {#googleDocs}
-----------

To create a folder and share it:

-   Select the **Create** button.
-   Select **Folder**
-   Enter your folder name: **MyFolder**
-   Click the **Create** button to create the folder
-   Right click on the newly minted Folder and choose **Share**
-   Enter the email address of people with whom you want to share the
    folder and select **Share and Save**. Optionally, you could make the
    entire folder public rather than sharing it with a limited audience.

To create a new document:

-   Navigate to the Google Drive folder where you want to create your
    document.
-   Click the **Create** button
-   Click **Document**
-   Type in text for your document.
-   In the upper left hand corner, click **Untitled Document** and give
    your document a new name.
-   You don’t need to do anything to save the document, as it will be
    saved automatically. Pressing **Ctrl-S** will force a save if you
    want more control.
-   The document will have the same rights as the folder in which you
    placed it, or you can explicitly modify the rights to the document
    by pressing the **Share** button in the upper right hand corner of
    the editor.

When editing a Google Document you will find a fairly rich set of tools
along the top of the header. Features include:

-   Hyperlink support
-   Text Background and foreground colors
-   Font and Font Size selection
-   Font formatting, including Normal, Title, Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.
-   Bold, Italic, Underline
-   Bullet points
-   Line spacing
-   Paint Format

To get a URL you can use when embedding an image in an HTML page:

1) Create a public folder on Google Drive. (Put check mark before the folder, choose sharing and set it to public.)
2) Put your images in that folder
3) Select an image, and inspect its Details. (More | Details from the menu)

In step three, you should see a link that you can copy and paste into
HTML IMG tags.

Google Sites {#googleSites}
------------

Google sites can automatically adjust its output to optimize for mobile
devices. Here is how to proceed.

-   Go to your Google Site
-   Make sure you are signed in
-   Choose **More | Manage Site**from the menu tabs at the top right of
    the site.
-   Near the bottom of the page, select the checkbox that reads
    “Automatically adjust site for mobile phones.”

Navigation
----------

You can use GPS to navigate to a location on a map using Google
Navigate. The application will show your route on the map, track your
location as you drive or walk to your destination, and give you
instructions when you reach important intersections.

Microsoft SkyDrive {#microsoftSkyDrive}
------------------

Microsoft SkyDrive is very flexible. You can store almost any kind of
file in it. For instance, you can upload zip files, bitmaps, Word
documents, text files, and source code for C\# programs, C++ or
JavaScript programs.

SkyDrive also provides support for viewing certain kinds of files,
mostly those that ship with Microsoft Office. If you upload a Word
document to SkyDrive, then you can view that document on SkyDrive, just
as you can view that document in Microsoft Office. SkyDrive is not,
however, a web server or a compiler. Thus you can store C\# source code
on SkyDrive, and you can store HTML or CSS files on SkyDrive, but you
can't compile the C\# code, or view the output of your HTML file by
simply clicking on it. If you do try to view the HTML file, you will see
the source for the HTML, the raw code, with the \<P\> and \<h1\> tags
visible.

In my classes, I may sometimes ask students to create a document on
SkyDrive. When I do so, it will be very rare for me to ask them to
create an HTML document to store on SkyDrive. It would make little sense
for me to do so in most cases, since SkyDrive is not a web server. If I
say: "Create or place a document on SkyDrive," I almost surely mean for
you to create a Word document, either by using Office, or by using the
online tools that Microsoft provides, and that are outlined below. If I
do want you to place an HTML document on SkyDrive, I will explicitly say
so, using the word HTML: "Please create an HTML and store it on
SkyDrive." It is not wrong to place an HTML document on SkyDrive, as
SkyDrive can serve as a simple storage mechanism. It is place to store
files of any type. But it is not a web server, and it will not serve up
HTML to a browser in the traditional sense.

Even if you are not a student, it is still important that you understand
what can and can't be done with a tool like SkyDrive. It is a very
useful tool, but it is an Application running in the cloud (SaaS), not a
development platform. For more information, see the page on [Types of
Cloud
applications](/charlie/development/cloud/TypesOfApplications.html).

To create a folder:

-   Go to your SkyDrive on the web
-   Select the Create option at the top on the left and choose
    **Folder**
-   Enter the name for your new folder and hit Enter.

To create a document:

-   Go to your SkyDrive site on the web
-   Navigate to the folder where you want to store your document
-   Choose **Create | Word Document**
-   Give your document a name: **MyDocument**
-   Type in the text for your document
-   Choose the File menu to save and exit your document

There are a rich set of Tools for editing a document in SkyDrive
including

-   Support for hyperlinks on the Insert page
-   Styles
-   Font and font size
-   Test foreground and background colors
-   Bold, italic, underline and strikethrough

LastPass {#lastPass}
--------

Keeping track of passwords while on the road is not easy. An program
that can help you maintain your passwords if very useful.

Twitter
-------

Here is a good overview of how to use Twitter

- [New York Times on Twitter](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/technology/personaltech/twitter-illiterate-mastering-the-bcs.html?src=me&ref=general)

Netflix
-------

If you have a Netflix account, you can stream videos directly to your
mobile device with the Netflix app for Android and iOS.

FireFox
-------

There is a version of the Mozilla FireFox
[browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox)
that is designed to run on Android. It is quite good, and is worth
installing. FireFox Mobile 23.0 scored a 426 on my Android Tablet when running
the HTML5 Test [Suite](http://www.html5test.com). That is actually a higher
score than I get with the desktop version of FireFox 23.01.

To get this to work right, you need to set up FireFox sync. Then you can
create your bookmarks and other preferences on your desktop, and transfer
them automatically to your mobile device.

I encountered one problem doing this. I was asked to produce a recovery key
that I no longer had access to. It was on a different machine, that I have
sense reformatted and rebuilt. However, if I followed the prompts, it was
possible to get a new copy of the key.
