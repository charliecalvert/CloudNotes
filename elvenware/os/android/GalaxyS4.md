Getting Help

The Galaxy S4 comes with a very nice help application. Unfortunately, it is
not immediately accessible from the home screen. Instead, you need to go 
to the Apps view, and open it from there.

From the long press on the home menu, you can also go to 
[Google Now](http://www.google.com/landing/now/) Cards. You
can reach this same feature by simply tapping the Google search input box
on the home screen.

The On-off Button
--------------------

The on/off button is on the right side, about 3/4 of the way up.

Long press it to bring up a screen to:

* Turn the machine off
* Go into Airplane mode
* Restart

Short tap this button to 

* put the phone in standby mode and lock the screen
* Shut the phone up if it rings at the wrong time

When the screen is locked, the phone is still active, but the screen is black
and you can't accidentally make a phone call or start most other activities.

Easy Mode
---------

On some devices, such as the Galaxy S4, you can switch from Standard Mode
to Easy Mode. Go to:

* Settings | My Device | Home Screen Mode
* Choose Easy Mode or Standard Mode

Here are some examples of Easy Mode. All the other screen shots on this page
unless explicitly stated otherwise, are of standard mode.

Here is the Home Screen in Easy Mode. Notice that there are now just two
panes in addition to the Home Screen. See the little icons at the very 
bottom of the screen? They show icons for the home page, and the two panes.

Galaxy S4 Sensors
-------

* Proximity Sensor
* Ambient light sensor: This is the tool used to dim or brighten the screen
according to the amount of light around you. In other words, if the room is
dark, the screen dims, if it is bright, then the screen gets bright.
* Accelerometer: It tells how fast the thing is moving, but also the phone's 
orientation
* Magnetometer: Turns your phone into a compass, and aids the accelerometer.
* Gyroscope: Measures your position in space and works with the accelerometer
* Weather related: Humidity, pressure, temperature
* Infared (RGB Light) Sensors: Used to pick up on your gestures so you can flip
through pictures or scroll through text without touching the screen
