## Details

Elvenware is very much a work in progress. It is, quite frankly, a set of
rough drafts for books. Furthermore, it is likely that these works will
remain in rough draft format for the foreseeable future.

I attempt to organize the material on this site in accord with the system
described below. Nevertheless, the best way to navigate the site remains 
Google. I provide Google search bars on some pages. Alternatively, you can go to
Google and search with the very useful **site** filter:

* Provide the search string
* Follow it with the word site followed by a colon
* List the site you want to search

```
[Search String] site:[site to search] 
```

Here are some examples:

* [JavaScript site:elvenware.com](http://www.google.com/search?q=JavaScript site:elvenware.com)
* [JavaScript Functions site:elvenware.com](http://www.google.com/search?q=JavaScript Functions site:elvenware.com)
* [Database MongoDb site:elvenware.com](http://www.google.com/search?q=Database MongoDb site:elvenware.com)

More details on searching with Google can be found [here][browser].

## Site Organization {#sitemap-description}

When organizaing material, I think in terms of sentences, paragraphs,
sections, chapters and books. I appreciate and applaud how Google and
StackOverflow have changed the way we find and rate data. Nevertheless, when
writing text, I don't think like a search engine or a rating system, I think
like an author. This does not mean that I don't use search and rating to
discover subjects of interest, it is simply that I don't list them strictly
by their rating. For instance, if I am writing about programming, and I find
that my pages on OOP are getting the most hits, I don't put them on the first
page of my book on Programming. I put basic material first, and then move on
to more advanced material. That doesn't mean that it is not useful to call out
the most popular pages on the site, but only that I don't continually reorder
my text to reflect the latest statistics from Google Analytics.

Some of the books I create are very small, but most of them will nonetheless 
have chapters, and most chapters will have sections and subsections. As a 
rule, each chapter can also be thought of as a single HTML page.

One place where this metaphor breaks down is when I include programs
meant to demonstrate concepts discussed in a particular book. In that case,
you can click on a link and discover live content, which is usually either a 
program, a movie or an MP3 file. This is really just a way of saying that
these "books" contain not only text, but also various programmatic and 
multimedia elements.
