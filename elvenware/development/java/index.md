## Overview

This page and all my material on Java is very old. Most of it is approximately 20 years old or older. As a result, I no longer include it on Elvenware. Perhaps someday I will try to restore it, but certainly not today.

For now, you can find this material here:

- [Charlie's Git repository for pages deleted from Elvenware](https://github.com/charliecalvert/deleted-from-elvenware.git)

**NOTE TO SELF**: _Charlie, you also have a copy on the big seagate drive._

## Welcome to Charlie's Java pages.

Begin hopelessly outdated home page. None of the links lead anywhere. Instead, see the repository mentioned above.

I have written a book on JBuilder called Learn JBuilder.

What will it cover. The current TOC, which is still changing daily, is linked below.

The Java Course link below contains the files that formed the basis for this book, but it has been through several metamorphoses since this text was written.

### Applets

(All these applets probably require a recent version of the [JRE Plugin](http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/index.html). Rather than attempting to install the plugin automatically, I am going to ask you to click the [Get Java Now](http://www.java.com) button shown above and go to Suns site and follow their easy to use download system. If you have been using old versions of the Java JRE, and have never seen what JRE 1.3 or 1.4 can do in a web browser, then I strongly recommend installing them, and then visiting some sites that have [up to date demos](http://java.sun.com/getjava/showcase.html) of this technology.)
