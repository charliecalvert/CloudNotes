## Elvenware CSharp Videos

There are two versions of the same videos. One page will load quickly
because it contains only links to the videos, which are on YouTube. The
second page has the videos "embedded in the page, and also provides
links back to YouTube.

Note that the more recent videos can be see in high definition. Just
look for the link along the bottom of the screen when you are playing
the video.

    videos](EmbeddedVideos.html)
