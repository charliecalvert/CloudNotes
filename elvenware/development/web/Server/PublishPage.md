Publish a Web Page {#publish}
------------------

A general description for setting up a web site in IIS is found
[here](SetupAWebSite.html). The following might be more useful in some
cases.

After you turn on IIS, you end up with a c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot directory.
This is the default web site.

You can start playing around with this default site. One approach is to
use the IIS Manager to create a virtual directory under the wwwroot
directory. You can access the IIS Manager through the Administrator
Tools in the Control Panel:

    Control Panel\System and Security\Administrative Tools

You can then **edit permissions** for the directory and give yourself
read write privilages.
