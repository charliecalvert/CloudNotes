Â and nit picks that not only can, but always do, surface when this topic
comes up. It turns out that HTML has answers to most of the objections,
but they come at a price. That price is complexity.

If you know enough about HTML, and you have the right browser running on
the right operating system, then you can correctly create and render
even very complex documents. These documents can contain all manner of
peculiar layout and many different multimedia features. The only problem
is that this visual richness and these panoply of features is the result
of the layering of increasing levels of complexity.

Is there anything that can be done to mitigate this surge of complexity
that stems from the desire to create richly formatted documents? It
turns out that there are solutions available, but that they in turn are
not always easy to understand. As in so many different creative fields,
much of the best HTML is simple HTML; only very skilled and
knowledgeable developers know how to create simple HTML that also meets
the needs of users who want to see rich, beautifully rendered content.

HTML has its roots in technologies that go back to at least the 1940s,
when Vannevar Bush first proposed the ideas that form the basis for what
we know as hypertext. Since the mid-nineties when the Internet gained
wide acceptance, variants of HTML very similar to those prevalent today
have been in wide use. In fact, most modern browsers can render a well
formed HTML document created in 1995.

It is 2013 as I write these sentences. This means that HTML has been in
widespread use for 15 to 20 years, depending a little on when you want
to mark the beginning of its use.

**NOTE**: *Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989, and the
first browsers that rendered an early version of HTML were released in
1991, and reached the general public in 1993. In June of 1993, the first
specification for the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) was published.*

In terms of human history, a technology that is only 20 years old is
still very new. For instance, cars and airplanes were still in their
infancy twenty years after the first models were created. But twenty
years of web technology is longer than it seems. This is the result of
the speed and volume of communication enabled by the web. Hundreds of
thousands of serious computer scientists and developers have been using
HTML intensely over those twenty years, and they have all been talking
to each other in great depth over the Internet, and in various printed
publications. This means that people have learned a lot about how to
write well formed HTML. The pace at which knowledge in this field has
grown has been astounding. If I go into a book store and find a book on
HTML that was written five years ago, in 2007, I will be wary about much
of what it says. All the code in the book will almost certainly work
perfectly well in modern browsers, but it will not follow many of the
best and most thoughtful conventions that have been delivered over the
last five years. If you go back further, to say 2003, then any book on
HTML written at that time might be not so much useless, as just plain
dangerous. People had a lot of ideas in the early oughts about how to
write good HTML, and it has turned out that many of them wrong. There
were a few people who knew how to write good HTML even back then, but
there were many more whose heads were full of bad ideas. Let me put that
in more politically palatable manner: Most of us who were writing HTML
in 2003 were going about it wrong. We would have been better sticking
with the simpler HTML markup available in 1991, than trying to adopt
many of the principles that gained currency in the early oughts.

These recent developments in the art of writing and rendering HTML are
anything but trivial. Huge strides have been made in recent years, and
new developments are unfolding at a tremendous rate. There are few
subjects in technology that are under such intense development as the
tools and standards that make up the confluence of the three
technologies known as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Why am I going into all this at such great length? What is the point?
The problem HTML developers face is quite simple: There are many legal
ways to create a complex HTML document, but most of them are overly
complex, hard to read, and ugly to look at. Well designed HTML, on the
other hand, is frequently easy to read, simple in structure, and even
somewhat aesthetically pleasing. I'm talking here about the markup
itself, not the rendered content we see in the browser.

Given the threat of encroaching complexity, your job as a creator of
HTML documents should include a desire to write simple, well formed
documents that follow the best modern standards. I've gone into a number
of digression, and rambled at considerable length, but I did so for
reason. Here is a summary of the points I have tried to make in this
section:

-   There is a type of HTML document that is very easy to write and very
    easy to understand. It uses few tags, and performs a relatively
    simple, but powerful task.
-   Most users and developers are not happy to use this simple subset of
    HTML. They want to create richer content that has more complex
    layout and more pleasing aesthetic qualities.
-   HTML has, from the perspective of computer technology, a long and
    rather jaded history. People have found many ways to render complex
    documents, and most of them have proven to be less than ideal.
-   In recent years, and in particular since about 2007, a set of
    guidelines for developing well formed HTML documents that produce
    rich content with relatively simple code has emerged.
-   Your job is to first master the simple basics of HTML development,
    and to then adopt the right techniques for creating more complex
    documents.

I will end this section with one final thought: When in doubt, write the
simplest possible code. If you create a document that uses only
**html**, **body**, **head**, **h1** and **p** elements, then absolutely
no one has any grounds for objecting to it. It would render correctly,
and it would fully and completely perform its job. Assuming you have
laid your document out following the guidelines described above, then
you could present it to the most sophisticated developer in the world,
and they would have to pronounce it not just good, but perfect. They
would have no grounds to object to it. In fact, if you encountered a
developer who said something to the effect of: "This sucks, it is just
way to simple," then you would know for certain that the person you were
speaking to only thought he was an expert. He wasn't a real expert. Real
experts understand and appreciate the elegance of simple, well rendered
HTML documents.
