Writing Code with Expression Web
--------------------------------

Here are some notes on using Expression Web

### Working with Panels and Workspaces

The panels are the windows that appear on the right and left of the
editor. For instance, Managing Styles, Folder List, and Tag Properties
are all panels. Use the Panels menu to display and manipulate the
panels.

You can hide or reveal all the panels by toggling F4. You can also have
multiple workspaces, or default arrangements of the panels.  There are
several default workspaces, but you can create new ones at any time.

-   Tag Properties
-   CSS Properties
-   Apply Styles
-   Manage Styles
-   ToolBox
-   Snippets

### Managing Styles

Use this panel to:

-   Attach a style sheet
-   Create a new style
-   View the style sheets attached to your currenct HTML file
-   See the selectors (styles) in the style sheet
    -   Blue: Tag
    -   Red: ID
    -   Green: Class

### Tag and CSS Properties

These are the two panels that usually appear on the bottom left of the
screen. They are meant to give you insight into the properties in effect
on a tag. If you want to apply or edit the CSS, use the Apply and Manage
Style windows which usually appear on the far right.

The Tag Properties show up on the left side of the IDE.

Quick Tag Selector
------------------

1.  Drop the little arrow and

1.  Select Tag - Selection the tag and contents
2.  Select Tag Contents - Select the tag contents
3.  Edit the tag in a pop up called the Quick Tag Editor
4.  Wrap the tag, which allows you to surround the tag with another tag.

### Working with DWT

1.  You can apply a DWT to an existing page
2.  Pick the file or files you want to update in the Folder List
3.  Choose Format | Dynamic Web Template | Attach Dynamic Web Template

### Reformatting HTML

1.  Go to code view
2.  Right in the code window or on the bar at the top.
3.  Choose Reformat HTML to reformat all the code in the file

 

### Search and Replace

1.  See the [Regular Expression](../regular_expressions/index.html)
    page.
