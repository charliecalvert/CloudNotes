# Soa

## Eight Principles

*   Normalized service contract.
*   Loose coupling between consumers and services, and between the services themselves.
*   Abstraction from implementation details; the consumers only know the contract
    without worrying about implementation details.
*   Ability to compose other services regardless of the complexity of the composition.
*   Run-time environment autonomy.
*   Statelessness.
*   Reusability.
*   Discoverability through meta data or public contract definitions.
