## Key Issues

Here are some issues that are commonly encountered by developers.

### Identity

*   Create your own
*   Open ID

### Stateless

Begin with an inventory

## Entry point:

*   Let's take this web application and put it into the cloud.
*   Some kinds of SaaS, a simple app
*   IT applications are siloed, but in the cloud applications can talk to one another
*   IT was about taking care of the technology
    *   Now we are concerned with managing technology
    *   In the nineties, we had people thinking that PCs would replace IT
    *   But in the end, companies still need experts, but a different kind of expert.
*   We need to be organized not around the technology, but around the services we provide

## Strategize

Don't react to problems, first create a plan and then implement it. Virtualization and the cloud won't solve a lot of problems.

*   Inventory your services.
*   Find places where you can succeed
*   Start small
*   Examine how things we run on the cloud versus run on a virtual machine or private cloud.
*   Ultimately the cloud is just a computer in a new place
