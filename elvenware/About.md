## Overview

I am retired now. I worked in various companies including Borland and Microsoft. For the last 10 years of my career I was in an adjunct professor at Bellevue College.

My work has been fairly technical. I've been working with computers and writing code in one form or another for about 30 years. I started out with Turbo Pascal and Delphi, spent time with Java, C++, Python and Perl, and then spent a number of years working in C#. at Bellevue College my focus was mostly on web apis written in JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

I've spent most of my career in industry, working first for Borland, then for two start- ups in Silicon Valley, and then for four years at Microsoft on the C# team. Over the last few years I've been interested primarily in Agile Development, the cloud and various mobile devices.

In many of my courses at BC we wrote web and mobile applications that use Cloud services. I'm also looking to learn new ways to use virtual machines, cloud resources and mobile devices.

These days I have had to slow down, but my favorite activities include hiking, snow-shoeing, swimming, reading and watching movies. I also like to write. I'm known in the computer world primarily as a book author:
