Cloud Coverage in Charlie's Courses
===================================

Here is a brief review of how the cloud is covered in the courses I 
teach. The cloud is such an important part of modern computing, that
it is perhaps useful to see which courses cover which aspects of 
cloud computing.

Prog 270 - Mobile Devices
--------

We use the cloud to the extent necessary to:

- Understand in a general way why the cloud is important and what it 
does for end users
- We have to have a neutral place to store data that can be accessed 
from both mobile devices and desktops. The cloud is that neutral 
location. Put a file in the cloud and you can reach it from any 
connected device
- Introduce end user cloud applications such as Google Drive, SkyDrive,
EverNote, etc.

Prog 280 - Cloud Computing
--------------------------

Review the points covered in 270 and

- Explore cloud applications, including Google Drive and SkyDrive
- Learn how the cloud works. Emphasis on AWS, EC2 and S3, plus Azure and
other Cloud Services
- Explore cloud services such as cloud based databases.
- Learn how to use Virtual Machines and some distributed tool like Hadoop or CouchDb

Prog 272, 282 Mobile and Cloud Development
-------------

- Develop applications that take advantage of cloud servers and services
introduced in 270 and 280.
- Learn about setting up web servers (Node and Apache, plus the web servers built into Jasmine and Aptana)
- Learn how to use web protocols such as HTTP and web services built on REST principles
- Learn how to host applications on cloud servers. Cover the Linux command line in some depth.

ISIT 320
--------

In a general way, we use the knowledge about the cloud learned in 
the previous classes. The focus, however, is on consuming services 
rather than exploring how to set them up. In 282, for instances, we 
explore what is available in the cloud, while in 320 we just set up 
a node server locally and let that stand in for what the cloud can 
do. The assumption being that folks already know (from 270, 280, 282 
and 272) how to set up node servers in the cloud. We also use a 
cloud database, which implies an understanding of REST, but I don't 
drill into it the way I do in 272 and 282. I just assume folks know 
what it is about, and if they don't, I give them enough knowledge to 
use it, but perhaps not enough to fully understand it. There just 
isn't time.
