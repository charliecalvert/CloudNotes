## Overview

The main goal is to create properly working versions of:

- AddressMaven
- FirebaseAddressMaven
  - Your Firebase code should be deployed to Firebase Hosting

I'll also be looking at:

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Tests

**NOTE**: _The firebase-tools were recently updated to v7.0.0. Be sure to run **ncu -g** and follow directions to install them and any other needed updates._

## Shutdown After Quarter

## Deploying Credentials

When you deploy your app to Firebase hosting and when you give it to me for grading, we need to make a change to **verify-db.js**.

The key step is to put your Service Account credentials file, the one we load with GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS, in the functions directory. I believe this file always begins like this:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "...": "etc"
}
```

Modify the start of **verify-db.js** to look like this:

```javascript
var admin = require('firebase-admin');
const credentialLoad=require('./credentials');

let loggedIn = false;

function init() {
    loggedIn = true;
    if (!admin.apps.length) {
        admin.initializeApp({
            credential: admin.credential.cert(credentialLoad)            
        });
    }
    return admin.firestore();
}
```

Here I'm assuming your Service credentials file is called **credentials.json**, but I don't suppose it matters what you call it, so long as your code works.

Recall that **initializeApp** used to look like this:

```javascript
admin.initializeApp({
    credential: admin.credential.applicationDefault()
});
```

This code assumed that **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** pointed to your credentials file. But that is problematic for me when grading, as I don't want to set up that variable for each of your assignments, and I'm not sure how to make it work when we deploy to Firebase hosting. This should work fine so long as your code is in a private repository. If you want to make your repo public at some point, do two things:

- remove the credentials file from the repository
- regenerate the credentials file, as there is no good way to delete old copies from your repository.

## Steps

I'll do something like this:

1. Look to see if you told me what folder you want me to look at.
  1. It should be **AddressMaven** and **FirebaseAddressMaven**
1. Ensure that you supply a link to your deployed version of **FirebaseAddressMaven**.

Here are some of the key steps I'll take when grading your assignment.

1. For **AddressMaven**, I'll go to that folder and start your program.
2. In the Menu for your program, I'll expect to see:
  1. Home
  2. Login
  3. Logout
  4. First
  5. Go
  6. AddressShow
  7. AddressForm (Default, empty component with only heading)
  8. AddressList (Default, empty component with only heading)
3. The user should be able to Login and Logout
4. After logging in, the user should be able to iterate through data in **AddressShow**
5. Run your tests, and have **prettier** and **eslint** come back clean

Another key set of steps:

1. Clear **localStorage** and clear the **address** collection in the Firebase Console
2. Login
3. Navigate to the Go page and populate the **address** collection
4. Reload the app, perhaps by going to the home page. This should pull from **address** and populate **localStorage**
5. Test **AddressShow**

These last set of steps don't have to be flawless. In other words, I don't expect you to check every possible path through the menu and ensure that they all work regardless of whether you are signed in, and regardless of whether or not there is data in the **address** collection. But the steps outlined above should work.

We should get this in a very clunk implementation for free, but I'm expecting to see some indicator of whether you are signed in or not. I don't care how it looks, but it is helpful to the user.

**NOTE**: _Just to be clear, I'm expecting to see you pass a Firebase user token from the client to the server and verify it on the server side before you return a value to the client. I suppose I would rather have working code without this feature than broken code with the feature. Or perhaps if you are uncertain, pick a single place like the first button we put in Go, as the place to try to make this work. If you do it only there, make that clear to me when you turn it in. But once you have it going one place, it is fairly easy to do it elsewhere. I'm definitely looking to see it implemented in most places in your code when you call from the client to the server, particularly when you retrieve the politician data from the server._

I would add just one more note, getting your code _deployed_ on Firebase Hosting will be a big win. If I see a link to your application running in the cloud, and that application works, then that is a big win. It proves to me that even if I am having trouble getting your code to work, you did create working code. Of course, it is best if your link to the cloud works, and I can run your code easily from the bash shell.

## Differences Between FirebaseAddressMaven and AddressMaven {#differences}

To get the Firestore code to work in **AddressMaven** you will probably have to install the **firebase-admin** package:

    npm i firebase-admin

You don't, however, need to do anything like **firebase init**, **firebase serve** or **firebase** deploy. All those commands have to do with creating a project that we can deploy to Firebase hosting. We are not going to deploy **AddressMaven**, only **FirebaseAddressMaven**.

## Extra Credit

One little nicety you'll want to implement is handling the case where **AddressShow** is called and there is no data to display. This might happen if the user is not logged in. There are various solutions to this problem and some are dependent on the way you implemented **AddressShow**. In my case I was able to resolve the problem by creating a fake record that can be shown to the user. Perhaps it might look a bit like this:

```javascript
if (!address) {
    address = {
        firstName: 'unknown',
        lastName: 'unknown',
        etc.
    }
}
```

But this solution might not work for all possible implementations of AddressShow. (I don't think there is necessarily a correct or even best implementation. So if they above doesn't work for you, then find one that will work for your implementation. I can't reasonably be expected to anticipate all possible solutions, so I can't provide hints for everyone...)

I believe you will need to do something similar for the **FirebaseLogout/FirebaseLogin** page.

I suggest renaming the page I called **FirebaseLogin.js** to **FirebaseLogout.js** just because it is a much more appropriate name. But be wary, as making that change requires that you make changes in several places in your application. These places aren't hard to find, as errors pop up pretty quickly, still I would push before making the change so that you find it easy to undo you changes if it doesn't work out for you. Remember that there is even a line of code in **FirebaseLogout.js** itself that will need to be updated to the new name.

If you do any of the extra credit steps, be sure to call it out when you submit the assignment. I ask this simply because it is too easy for me to overlook some steps that you have taken, or to remember to include them when I calculate your grade.

I'm not really expecting anyone to do this, but implementing **AddressLister** to show all the address records at once on one page would also be worthy of extra credit.

Getting the tests to pass on AddressMaven is a must, getting them to pass on FirebaseAddressMaven would be a small amount of extra credit. One will fail because the views directory has moved.

How I got them to work from my history file. I was working in the root of the **FirebaseAddressMaven** project:

    mkdir sanity-tests
    2136  cd sanity-tests/
    2137  cp ../../AddressMaven/sanity-tests/* .
    2138  cd ..
    2139  npm i jest
    2142  npm i elven-code
    2144  npm i enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer    
    2146  cp -rvp ../AddressMaven/__mocks__ .
    2148  npm test

## Firebase Address Maven

I'm looking for all the same features as in **AddressMaven**, but I should be able to start the app with **firebase serve** and view it online because you have run **firebase deploy** and ensured that your code works.

## Port 30025

It's easier for me for various reasons if your Firebase app starts on Port 30025 when we use **firebase serve**. The command to do that is:

    firebase serve --port=30025

Therefore we should modify the **start** property of our **scripts** object in the copy of **package.json** found in the root of our **FirebaseAddressMaven** project to look like this:

    "start": "npx webpack --watch & firebase serve --port=30025",

Be sure to push your work.

## Database

Add a second button to your **Go** page. When the user selects the button, call a route on the server called **/write-to-db**. On the server, in the **/write-to-db** endpoint, read the data from **address-list.json** and write it to the database.

The address data should be written to a collection called 'address'. Each document in the collection should contain data for one politician. The name of the document should be **lastname-firstname**. For instance: **Alexander_Lamar**.

Create another server side route called **/address-list-db**. It should do the same thing as **/address-list**, but it should return data from the database, not from **address-list.json**.

**NOTE**: _Some of you called the server side route **/get-address-list** rather than **/address-list**. The point is not what it was called, but what it did._

Base your code for reading and writing to the database on the code in the **ElfExpressFirestore** example. Note that I have added code for reading and writing batch data and snapshots. See **batch.js** in the example.

## Example Programs

See the [ElfExpressFirestore][eef] demo in JsObjects for more information on basic database operations.

To add **verify** to your calls, see the [ElfExpressFirestoreVerify][eefv] demo in JsObjects.

I have put both examples in the **JsObjects/JavaScript/Firebase** directory. Don't forget to call **git pull** to get the latest.

## Turn it in

Be sure to include the Firebase Hosting address to which you have deployed your Firebase app.

State the names of directories where you deployed your code. I'm expecting to see:

- AddressMaven
- FirebaseAddressMaven
- The branch if relevant. Even if you use branches, your final code should also be merged into **master**

Before your final push run **./prettier** and **eslint .** and make sure they come back clean.

After your final push tag your work and give me the tag.

## Duplicate App Error

You may get this error when you try to verify the Firebase user token:

    app/duplicate-app: The default Firebase app already exists. This means you called initializeApp() more than once without providing an app name as the second argument. In most cases you only need to call initializeApp() once. But if you do want to initialize multiple apps, pass a second argument to initializeApp() to give each app a unique name."

Put this fix, or something similar in **verify-db** on the server side:

```javascript
function init() {
    loggedIn = true;
    if (!admin.apps.length) {
        admin.initializeApp({
            credential: admin.credential.applicationDefault(),
        });
    }
    return admin.firestore();
}
```

The idea here is that **admin.apps.length** checks to see if **initializeApp** has already been called.
