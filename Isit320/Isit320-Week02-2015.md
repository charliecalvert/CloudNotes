GIT Notes
---------

Learning or reviewing GIT is always important. Your primary resources is the Elvenware GIT page, but Kurt has also put together some nice tips.

- [Elvenware Git](/charlie/development/cloud/Git.html)
- [Git Tips from Kurt](GitTipsFromKurt.html)

If you are trying to use GIT, and get an error like "The server's host key is not cached in the registry", then see this page:
