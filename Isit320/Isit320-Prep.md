#ISIT 320 Prep, Fall 2014

Students sometimes ask me what they can learn ahead of time to help them get ready for ISIT 320. Below I list a few suggested areas of study. There is no need to do any of these things, but sometimes students do have free time during the summer and they want to put it to good use.

I apologize for the condition of the text on [Elvenware][1]. At some point it will get cleaned up.

## GIT

With Git, it is great if you know the GUI, definitely useful, but it is also helpful if you can work from the command line. All you really need to master are the basic commands:

- git clone
- git push
- git pull
- git add
- git commit
- git mv XXX
- git rm XXX

That usually takes care of it, but knowing how to merge a file that has changes from two different sources is also good. If you want a more advanced topic, understanding Git branching and tagging is also helpful, but probably not necessary.

##LINUX 
On Linux, it is nice if you know a few command line basics:

- cp
- mv
- rm
- cd
- pwd

And generally anything found here:

##JavaScript

If you want to prep for JavaScript, the single most useful things to learn are:

- callbacks
- The difference between the syntax for objects and function objects

    - http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/web/JavaScript/JavaScriptFunctions.html
- Node basics: http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/web/JavaScript/NodeJs.html

You don't have to learn any of these things before class starts, but if you do have a little background in these areas, it will make the course easier for you. As I said earlier, the best one to get out of the way is understanding Git. It's just great not to fuss with that subject when you trying to learn how JavaScript works.
