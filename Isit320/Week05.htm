<h3 id="assignment-02-gitignore">Assignment 02: GitIgnore</h3>
<p>When working in your repository, there are some files that you probably don't want to check in. These include any files in the following directories:</p>
<pre><code>.metadata
.c9revisions
node_modules</code></pre>
<p>If you have already checked in these files to your repository, it is simpler to leave there than to remove them. Nevertheless, you can ensure that your folders don't get an larger than they are now.</p>
<p>Create a file called .gitignore. That's GITIGNORE with a PERIOD in front of it: .gitignore.</p>
<p>Create or open the file in your editor. This sounds like a simple thing, but on Linux or Cloud 9, files that begin with a period are hidden. Right click on your folder in Cloud 9, and choose show hidden files. In Linux, type <strong>ls -la</strong> to see hidden files.</p>
<p>Inside gitignore add the following three lines:</p>
<pre><code>.metadata
.c9revisions
node_modules</code></pre>
<p>The first folder holds information used workspaces in Eclipse/Aptana. The second folder holds backup copies of files you have edited on Cloud 9, and the third holds libraries used by Node. None of these directories needs to be stored on GitHub.</p>
<p>Add and check in your .gitignore file:</p>
<pre><code>add .gitignore
commit -m &quot;Adding GitIgnore File&quot;
git push</code></pre>
<p>When you are done, submit the URL of your repository.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-03-project-names">Assignment 03: Project Names</h3>
<p>This is busy work, but it is very helpful to me if you create useful names for your projects in Aptana. Here is the contents of a typical .project file that is used by Eclipse/Aptana to define the name of your project:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;projectDescription&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;week3&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;comment&gt;&lt;/comment&gt;
        &lt;projects&gt;
        &lt;/projects&gt;
        &lt;buildSpec&gt;
                &lt;buildCommand&gt;
                        &lt;name&gt;com.aptana.ide.core.unifiedBuilder&lt;/name&gt;
                        &lt;arguments&gt;
                        &lt;/arguments&gt;
                &lt;/buildCommand&gt;
        &lt;/buildSpec&gt;
        &lt;natures&gt;
                &lt;nature&gt;com.aptana.projects.webnature&lt;/nature&gt;
        &lt;/natures&gt;
&lt;/projectDescription&gt;</code></pre>
<p>When I open this project in Aptana, it is called <strong>week3</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;name&gt;week3&lt;/name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>There are three problems with names like this in the context of our course:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I can't tell whose project it is. Week3, yes, but Week3 by which student?</li>
<li>Each project name in Aptana needs to be unique. If you submit a project named <strong>week3</strong>, and student x also submits a project with the name <strong>week3</strong>, then Aptana balks. I have to open the appropriate <strong>.project</strong> file, edit the name, and try again to import it.</li>
<li>There might be multiple submissions for one week, and so naming the project week3 doesn't tell me which assignment from week3 is in the project folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please go through all the .project files in your repository and set their names using the following style:</p>
<ul>
<li>LastName-WeekXX-AssignmentName</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be able to right click on the projects in Aptana/Eclipse and rename them directly. This should change the contents of your .project files, but please check to make sure that it does. If you change the name of a project that has already been imported into Aptana by editing the .project file, then the next time you open Aptana you won't be able to open that particular project. You should then delete the project from Aptana and reimport it, or do something similar that has the same affect.</p>
<p>If you opt to edit the .project files directly, or you want to check your work, here is one entirely optional way to proceed. At the command prompt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the root of your repository</li>
<li>Enter this command: <strong>dir /s /b .project &gt; openProjects.bat</strong></li>
<li>Edit openProjects.bat in NotePad++</li>
<li>Use the regular expression shown below to tell NotePad++ to open all your .project files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: npp.bat is a batch file that I have on my path that points to notepad++. Here is the contents of that batch file:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\Notepad++.exe&quot; %1 %1 %1</code></pre>
<p>Here is how to search and replace using regular expressions in NotePad++:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/RegEx01.png" alt="RegEx01" /><figcaption>RegEx01</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>**Figure01: See the <a href="../Images/RegEx01.png">full size image</a></p>
<p>Here is the regex:</p>
<ul>
<li>^: Go to the beginning of the line</li>
<li>(.*): Capture all the text on that line in a variable called \1</li>
<li>call npp: Enter the letters npp as literals. Or call npp.bat if you prefer.</li>
<li>\1: paste in the contents of the  variable, which is set to .*</li>
</ul>
<p>So a RegEx of <strong>^(.*)</strong> captures a line of text</p>
<p>And this RegEx replaces it with npp plus the captured line of text: <strong>call npp \1</strong></p>
<p>RegEx is a bit terse, and you don't really have to understand it. But it is nice to know.</p>
<p>Here is what openProjects.bat looked like in one repository before I edited it using search and replace as shown in the image:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\ArrayTwoDimensions\.project
C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\Branching01\.project

C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week2\.project
C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week3\.project</code></pre>
<p>Here is what it looked like after edit it with the regular expression shown in the image:</p>
<pre><code>npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\ArrayTwoDimensions\.project
npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\Branching01\.project
npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\ForLoopNested\.project
npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\Loops01\.project
npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week1\PrimitiveTypes\.project
npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week2\.project
npp C:\Src\Git\Isit320\A01\ISIT320-XXX\week3\.project</code></pre>
<p>Once it was edited, I could just run the batch file and all the project files opened in NotePad++. Here is what it looked like:</p>

<p>When you are done, check in your work and submit the URL of your repository. I know this is busy work, and I should have made all this clear earlier, but lets straighten it out now. Thank you.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-04-roll-dice">Assignment 04: Roll Dice</h3>
<p>Create a program that simulates rolling dice. We will need to roll a wide array of dice. Here is how it works.</p>
<p>The kind of die you see most often has six possible values:</p>
<pre><code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</code></pre>
<p>This kind of die is called a d6</p>
<p>In most games we play, there are 2 d6 dice. This is called 2d6:</p>
<pre><code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</code></pre>
<p>For instance the first die might roll a 2, and the second a 6, this would return a value of 8. It is not possible for a d6 die to return 0 or 7.</p>
<p>We will also need 3 6 sided dice, which is called 3d6:</p>
<pre><code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</code></pre>
<p>But not all dice have 6 sides. Some, for instance, have four. This kind of die is called a d4:</p>
<pre><code>1, 2, 3, 4</code></pre>
<p>And of course tehre are d10s with possible return values between 1 and 10 inclusive, and d20s, with possible return values between 1 and 20 inclusive.</p>
<p>I want you to create a program with 6 buttons on it. Each button will return the result of a different kind of dice roll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Button01: D6</li>
<li>Button02: 2D6</li>
<li>Button03: 3D6</li>
<li>Button04: D4</li>
<li>Button05: D10</li>
<li>Button06: D20</li>
</ul>
<p>For the 2D6 and 3D6 rolls, I want you to display not only the result of the roll, but the actual value that each die returned:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/Dice01.png" alt="A roll of the 3D6" /><figcaption>A roll of the 3D6</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Figure01: Three dice were rolled. They returned a 5, 1, and 3 for a total of 9.</strong> <a href="../Images/Dice01.png">See full size</a></p>
<p>Your solution should be more complex than this. I'm only showing the results for one sixth of the answer in this screen shot.</p>
<p>I want you to also run tests that confirm that over 250 rolls, each of your rolls return values that are within the appropriate range. For instance, You should roll your 2D6 dice 250 times and confirm that the result is always between 1 and 12, inclusive. You don't need to write 250 tests, you just call your roll 250 times and confirm that it never returns a value outside the range. If it does return a value outside the range, then the test should fail, otherwise, it passes.</p>
<p>Here is how to roll a D3:</p>
<pre><code>var rollD3 = function() {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;
};</code></pre>
<p>I think you can figure it all out from there. To return a six sided die roll, multiply by 6, not by 3. To return the result of rolling two six sided dice, call rollD6() twice, and add up the results. And so on. Or do something altogether different, if you prefer. Its all good so long as it works, and it isn't too verbose.</p>
<p>When rolling a 2D6 you would also want to tuck the values returned by each die away somewhere so you can display them to the user. Whether you just store the result of the two rolls in a single string, or in two separate number variables is up to you.</p>
<p>I stumbled across a nice little bug when I first started writing this code. Suppose you tried to call the results of a roll directly in an angular place holder:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;{{getD3Roll()}}&lt;p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Angular will execute callD3Roll() which in turn calls your rollD3() function. Then every so often Angular checks to see if anything has changed by executing one of its watch() methods. Since the callD3Roll() function returns a random number, Angular will frequently find that the result has changed. I think in this case we have a 1 in 3 chance of the number not changing. So it updates the View. Then it checks to see if the value has changed. Whoops. It's changed, so it updates the view. And so on. If this happens often enough, it will assume it is stuck in some kind of loop, and start malfunctioning. You might not notice the errors unless you have your console view open in the debugger. But my experience shows that it will start malfunctioning if you do something like this.</p>
<p>The solution, of course, is to never call the rollD3 function that way. Instead, just call it on a button click:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;button ng-click=&#39;getD3Roll()&#39;&gt;Roll D3&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This puts the onus on the user to check for a new value, rather than on Angular itself. And of course you have to figure out some way of getting the answer back into the view, but I'll let you figure out a good way to solve that problem. The key point is that the button click solution ensures that a new value appears only when the user requests it. Now Angular is happy, and the errors go away.</p>
<p>Put your implementation in a your repo in a folder called <strong>Week05-RollDice</strong> and submit the URL for your repo.</p>
