###Change Bitmaps on the fly

I have now updated Crafty06 to include code to change the bitmap of 
an entity on the fly. It turned out to be quite simple, as shown in
Food.js:

	this.sprite(1, 0);

Here 1 and 0 and indexes into the grid of the bitmap associated with 
the component. You associated the bitmap with the component like this:

```
Crafty.load(assets, function(){
	Crafty.sprite(32, assets[0], {
		spr_tree:    [0, 3],
		spr_bush:    [2, 0],
		spr_village: [0, 1],
		spr_food: [1, 0]			
	});
	etc....
```

To see the code, pull down the latest Crafty.06, and look in **Food.js**.
