###Assignment 01

- Your own graphics
- Create somekind of Player model with health, name
- Create some kind of Village model with health, name
- Modify the encounter so that the player can lose health
- If you need more details than you can possible handle:
	- BasicFantasy.org

Here are some hints that you can follow optionally.

**How can I tell that an encounter occurred?**

Look at about Line 86 in **Player.js** from CraftyDemo05:

```
Crafty.game.reportEvent("Found Tower: " + data[0].obj._entityName);
if (Crafty.game.encounter(data[0].obj)) {
	villlage = data[0].obj;
	villlage.visit();
} else {
	this.encounterMode = true;
}
```

This means that the elfgame.encounter() method is passed a village:

```
elfgame.encounter = function(village) {
	var result = rollD3(village);
```

**How can I tell that a village was created during startup?**

Look at about line 44 in **Scene.js** from CraftyDemo05:

```
if (Crafty('Village').length < max_villages && !this.gameBoard[x][y]) {
	var village = Crafty.e('Village').at(x, y);
	village.setName(village._entityName.replace('Entity', 'Village'));
	Crafty.game.newVillage(village);
}
```

You can see that I have added a line that calls a new method of 
**elfgame** (from ElfGame.js) called **newVillage**:

```
var towers = [];

elfgame.newVillage = function(village) {
	village.tower = people.tower();
	towers.push(village);
	};
```

**How is people.tower() implemented?**

**people** is a method of an object that I created in a new 
module called **characters** that has a factory called **people**.
The tower method is part of a larger object called people. It creates 
a new, unique instance of a tower:

```
tower: function() {
	return {
		hitPoints: 4,
		damage: 1,
		bonusDamage: function() {
			return Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) + 1;
		},
		bonusHitPoints: function() {
			return Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 1;
		}
	};    
}
```

As you can see, a tower has 4 hitpoints. That means he can sustain
4 points of damage before "dying". He wields, by default, one point
of damage each time he hits. So you could start performing encounters
with lines like this in them:

```
people.hero.hitPoints -= village.tower.damage + village.tower.bonusDamage();
```

In this code, a hero is also part of people. It looks a lot like a 
tower, but there should be only one of him. So we don't return him
from a function that creates a unique object, we just define one
hero:

```
hero: {
	hitPoints: 12,
	damage: 2,
	bonusDamage: function() {
		return Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) + 1;
	},
	bonusHitPoints: function() {
		return Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 1;
	}
},
```

You don't have to follow this pattern, but it is one way to start 
having encounters with some meaningful action in them.
