Anything you expected to do at home that is not covered in class will
be put here.

###Assignment Part I

Using Angular, create an editable grid of objects called NPC.
Each object should have four fields:

- NPC Name: string
- HitPoints: number
- Health: number
- TotalMoves: number

Your program must pop up a dialog and allow you to edit
all four fields of each of the four objects. You edit
the objects one at a time:

- Click a button to edit object1
- Edit the object
- Save the results back to the original screen

Then the user can push another button to edit object2,
and so on.

Write a Unit Test that confirms that each object has:

- Four Fields
- Each field has the correct type.
- And the first record has the following values
	- Lucy
	- 25
	- 32
	- 0

###Assignment Part II

Provide a link to your Code Academy account showing that you have taken:

- Web Fundamentals to at least: 33%
- JavaScript to at least: 25%

[Example](http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536)

Please put your picture in your Code Academy site, or link to your 
Google Site, or provide some other means of clearly linking yourself 
to the URL you provide.
