Long Builds in Aptana
---------------------

If you are experiencing long Builds in Aptana, try right clicking on
**node-modules** in the Project window and choosing:

	Build | Exclude from Build

The Project we Built in Class
-----------------------------

- [Can be found here](https://github.com/charliecalvert/JsObjects/tree/master/JavaScript/Design/AngularModularKarma)

See these notes on creating the project:

Working with Bitmaps
--------------------

Animate changes to a sprite when it's state changes. In Crafty 06 you
can find examples of how to do this. The key code is in **Food.js**,
particularly the calls this.sprite:

	visit: function() { 'use strict';
		this.count++;
		switch (this.count) {
			case 1:
				this.sprite(1, 0);
				break;
			case 2:
				this.sprite(2, 0);
				break;

			case 3:
				this.sprite(3, 0);
				break;

			default:
				this.destroy();
				break;
		}

See also **scenes.js**:

	Crafty.sprite(32, assets[0], {
		spr_tree:    [0, 3],
		spr_bush:    [1, 3],
		spr_village: [0, 1],
		spr_food: [0, 0]			
	});

###Project

There is now an add on (a Ruble) for Aptana that will allow you to 
create Elven Angular Projects and other things. See the ReadMe for
details:

- [Elf Ruble README](https://github.com/charliecalvert/ElfRuble/blob/master/README.md)

I've just started working on this Ruble, so it is still in a nascent 
form, but ulimately it will be a much better way to get you the code
that you need. Please hvae patience while it is being developed.

For more information please follow the instructions found here that describe how to install
Project Templates into Aptana:

- [New Project Templates](http://elvenware.com/charlie/development/web/JavaScript/Angular.html#angular-starter-projects)

Also, see this:

- [Basic Karma](https://github.com/charliecalvert/AngularKarma/blob/master/README.md)
- [Mongo](https://github.com/charliecalvert/AngularMongoBootstrapTest/blob/master/README.md)

###More on Karma

If you have karma running in one command window, you can run a test in another 
command window that will return immediately  by typing:

	karma run
