## Isit320 Week01 2016

There is no main text for this course. Though not always as well organized as I would like, there are plenty of resources:

- [Resources](Isit320-Resources.html)

Perhaps the single best resource is Google search. The best way to learn to search is simply to practice: the more you search the better you feel. Nevertheless, it helps to understand a few basic rules about how Google search works:

## Install Pristine Lubuntu into VirtualBox {#virtualbox-lubuntu}

In this class we use a copy of Lubuntu running in Virtual Box. The first step is to download the custom Lubuntu OVA VirtualBox VM File from Google Drive. This is a copy of the Linux Lubuntu desktop specially prepared for this course. Here is a link to the approximately 3.0 GB download:

* [http://bit.ly/pristine-lubuntu-2016-sept-02](http://bit.ly/pristine-lubuntu-2016-sept-02)

Once the OVA file is downloaded, consider moving it to some save location such as your **Documents/Data** directory. You can simply click on the OVA file to load it in VirtualBox. When doing so, select the option that reads something like **re-initialize Mac address**.

If you get a warning about USB drivers, this usually means that the Virtual Box virtual extensions are not installed. This could be due to a mistake by the Bellevue College IS department. If you have the rights, install them from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), using the Virtual Box **Preferences** menu. (Or just double click on the download). Otherwise, you can go to **Settings | USB** for your VM and turn USB off for now.

Here is a somewhat dated link to a more detailed description of what to do with the OVA file once you download it:

###Code Academy

For the second part of the assignment, I want you to complete some
simple exercises in Code Academy. This should help you recall a few
basic facts about HTML and JavaScript, in case you need to brush up
on your skills.

- [Go to Web Fundamentals](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
- Complete *HTML Basics* and *Build Your own Web Page*
- [Go to JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
- Complete *Getting Started with Programming*

###Video

Finally, I suggest that we watch some Google IO.

- [Instant Mobile WebSites](https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/325128936)
- The video is about 37 minutes.
- There may be a quiz of some kind to confirm that you watched it.
