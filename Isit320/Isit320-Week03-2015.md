## Ways to Create Objects

Look at Object Demo 03. 
Extend a function with a prototype:

```
var MyFunction03 = function() {
    'use strict';       
};

MyFunction03.prototype.field01 = 2;
MyFunction03.prototype.field02 = 4;
MyFunction03.prototype.nestedFunction = function() {
    'use strict';    
    return this.field01 + this.field02;    
};
```

Node and NPM
------------

- [Node on Elvenware](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/web/JavaScript/NodeJs.html)

Perhaps some of you noticed that I could not run **jshint** from the 
command line in class on Wednesday, Sept 28. It turned out that the 
problem was that my copy of JsHint from NPM was out of date. Here is 
what I did to fix it:

	npm update -g
	
That command updates all the globally installed copies of your NPM
libraries. If you don't yet have JsHint installed for use on the 
command line, then issue the following command:

	npm install -g jshint

Anything you expected to do at home that is not covered in class will
be put here.

###Assignment Part I

Using Angular, create an editable grid of objects called NPC.
Each object should have four fields:

- NPC Name: string
- HitPoints: number
- Health: number
- TotalMoves: number

Your program must pop up a dialog and allow you to edit
all four fields of each of the four objects. You edit
the objects one at a time:

- Click a button to edit object1
- Edit the object
- Save the results back to the original screen

Then the user can push another button to edit object2,
and so on.

Write a Unit Test that confirms that each object has:

- Four Fields
- Each field has the correct type.
- And the first record has the following values
	- Lucy
	- 25
	- 32
	- 0

###Assignment Part II

Provide a link to your Code Academy account showing that you have taken:

- Web Fundamentals to at least: 33%
- JavaScript to at least: 25%

[Example](http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536)

Please put your picture in your Code Academy site, or link to your 
Google Site, or provide some other means of clearly linking yourself 
to the URL you provide.

You can submit the [assignment on Canvas](https://bc.instructure.com/courses/870287/assignments/2908125).
