# CloudNotes

My markdown files for the CloudNotes site.

Ordered by class, with HTML in some cases, but only partial HTML.

## Walk Markdown Files

In the lib directory is a file called [walk-markdown-files](lib/walk-markdown-files.mjs). It provides an example of how to walk through a Directory or recursive set of directories to see all the files present with a markdown extension, and to test if they have front matter or not.

Run it like this:

```javascript
node lib/walk-markdown-files.mjs
```

## RegEx

```regex
// , ([^-]*)-([^, ]*)
// const guideRegex = /([^-]*)-([^, ]*)/g;
// , "$1$2"
```

```regex
^(.*)\n--+
## $1
```

Figures:

```regex
^(!\[.*)\n
| $1_ |\n
```

make it a table, like this:

```markdown
| ![Starting node in debug mode](images/Node01.png) |
|:--:|
| _Figure D01: Starting node in debug mode_ |
```

> Terminal â€º Integrated: Allow Chords
The configurable terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell setting determines which command's keybindings should always "skip the shell" and instead be handled by VS Code's keybinding system. By default, it contains a hard-coded list of commands that are integral to the VS Code experience but you can add or remove specific commands:
