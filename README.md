# CloudNotes

My markdown files for the CloudNotes site.

Ordered by class, with HTML in some cases, but only partial HTML.

## Walk Markdown Files

In the lib directory is a file called [walk-markdown-files](lib/walk-markdown-files.mjs). It provides an example of how to walk through a Directory or recursive set of directories to see all the files present with a markdown extension, and to test if they have front matter or not.

Run it like this:

```javascript
node lib/walk-markdown-files.mjs
```

## Not Sure What This Is

npm i -D concat-stream gray-matter list-item markdown-link minimist
npm i -D mixin-deep remarkable repeat-string strip-color object.pick
npm i -D diacritics-map lazy-cache

```text
Could not find a declaration file for module 'elven-code'. '/home/ubuntu/Git/CloudNotes/node_modules/elven-code/index.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
  Try `npm i --save-dev @types/elven-code` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module 'elven-code';`ts(7016)
```
