## Description

Add CSS to your Resume.

**NOTE:**: _The content should look reasonably okay on both a desktop and mobile device. Do the best you can even if the result is not as well formatted as you may wish. Be patient and don't strive for perfection. We will iterate later until we get it right._

*   Link in a CSS file called **styles.css.** In it define the following rule:

<pre class="code">body {  
  font-size: 133%;  
  font-family: sans-serif;  
}  
</pre>

As you can see, I like large fonts! My eyes tire easily, so I use the tools to make my life easier.
