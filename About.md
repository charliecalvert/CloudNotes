## Overview

I'm an adjunct professor at Bellevue College. I've been working with computers and writing code in one form or another for about 25 years. I started out with Turbo Pascal and Delphi, spent time with Java, C++, Python and Perl, and then spent a number of years working in C#.

I've spent most of my career in industry, working first for Borland, then for a start up in Silicon Valley, and until a few years ago I was at Microsoft on the C# team. Over the last few years I've been interested primarily in Agile Development, the cloud and various mobile devices.

In many of my courses we write web and mobile applications that use Cloud services. I'm also looking to learn new ways to use virtual machines, cloud resources and mobile devices.

I enjoy hiking, snow-shoeing, swimming, reading and watching movies. I also like to write. I'm known in the computer world primarily as a book author:
