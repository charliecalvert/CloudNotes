Perform the actions demonstrated in the video.

## AllSets

You can download AllSets.json from [http://mtgjson.com](http://mtgjson.com).
The simplest way to proceed is to use this command to get the file from the Linux command prompt:

```
wget http://mtgjson.com/json/AllSets.json
```

## Overview

Here are the two main projects:

- **ParseMagic**: Read **AllSets.json** and use Mongoose to load the meta-data about each  set into a MongoDb collection called **magic-sets**.
- **WriteCards**: Read **AllSets.json** and use Mongoose to load the information about each card in a set into a collection. That program just loads the cards from one set called **LEA**.

## Turn it in

In a folder called **Week10-MongooseMagic**, check in **LEA.json** and the JSON files for any two other MTG sets.

Include four screen shots when you submit the assignments. Attach the screenshots to the assignment itself in either PNG or JPG format. 

The screen shots:

- Your mongolab main database page before you insert **magic-sets** and **magic-cards**.
- Your mongolab main database page after you insert **magic-sets** and **magic-cards**.
- A view of the data from **magic-sets** on MongoLab. Show the default view of the collection when you view it on MongoLab.
- A screen shot of the command line on your system after you finish running this command:
    - node WriteMagic.js 

## Notes

One thing to be careful about. Recently I set up a **.gitignore** file in the JsObject's project folder with the following in it:

```
AllSets.json
???.json
p???.json
???_???.json
FRF_UGIN.json
CONOT.json
```

My goal was to be sure I did not check in any of the JSON files generated by the program. However, I want you to check in three of them as part of the assignment. As a result, you should probably either delete or modify the **.gitignore** file if you have copied it into the folder you want to submit as part of the assignment. 

Let me state that again slightly differently. If you have copied the entirety of my **MongoooseMagic** project into your **Week10-MongooseMagic** folder, then be careful about the contents of the **.gitignore** file I recently added to my project. The problem is that it may prevent you from checking in some of the files I require as part of this assignment. 

There is a syntax that lets you tell .gitignore to make exceptions for specific files:

- <http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>

Since I wrote the above, and after studying the docs for **gitignore**, I have modified my **.gitignore** to look like this:

```
*.json
!package.json
```

This says that git should ignore all files with a **.json** extension except for **package.json**. You can modify **.gitignore** and use this same syntax to allow you to check in certain files required for this assignment. For instance here is how to tell git to let you check in **LEA.json**:

*.json
!package.json
!LEA.json

and so on.... The above would prevent you from checking in any JSON files except **package.json** and **LEA.json**. Assuming you have the **.gitignore** file in your directory, to complete the assignment, you would need to add additional lines to **.gitignore**. 

Please don't check in all your JSON files, and especially not the large file called **AllSets.json**.

## Mongoose on Linux

On Linux, I need to install libkrb5-dev before I can install the Mongoose
NPM package.

sudo apt-get install libkrb5-dev
