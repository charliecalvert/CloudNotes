Week02
======

Here are a couple projects we can work on in class. If you don't have time to finish
them in class, try to get them as soon as you can. I will, however, note the date
of your submission.

Project01
---------

- Create a project called MilesObject
- Add Index.js
- Add JavaScript object called milesConvert
- Add two fields: miles property, set it to 3
- Add feetPerMile, set it to 5280
- Add method called milesToFeet and implement it
- Call your method
- Add Jasmine Test
- Make sure your code passes JSHint

Optional (for now):

- Add Grunt JsHint support
- Add QUnit Test
- Add Karma Support

Project02
---------

- Create a project in Aptana called MilesFunction
- Like above, but make the object be a JavaScript Function, not an object.
- Add index.js
- Add JavaScript function called milesConvert
- Repeat above, but pass in miles as parameter

Some hints on how to create the function:

```
var MyFunc = function() {

	var name = 'sam';

	this.sayName = function() {
		console.log(name);
	};
};

var myFunc = new MyFunc();
myFunc.sayName();
```

You will need to call new in your tests:

	it ("can create milesFunction", function() {
		expect(new milesFunction()).toBeTruthy();
	});
