    ## Domain Names on GitHub IO

Create a CNAME document in the root of your repository. Mine looks like this:

    www.ccalvert.net

That's the entire contents of the file, with the text flush left

On GitHub, go to setings. Look for the section on your GitHub pages.

That's the total contents of the file.

Go to your GoDaddy account.

Go to the domain page.

Choose to manage your domain.

In the DNS zone file page, set the CNAME alias for www to:

    username@github.io
