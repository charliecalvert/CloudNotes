## Description

In our shared Evernote folder (notebook), create a note (document) with the notes you take on our Monday class. During class, we will go over various subjects germane to the final. I'm looking for notes that highlight the subjects we covered that are of interest to you.

When the day is over, block copy the notes and paste them into a document in our shared Google Drive folder called **FinalNotes**.

## Turn it in

Just submit the assignment.  I'll look in our shared folders for your work.

Your notes don't have to be extensive, but I want to see that you made notes about  at least a few subjects covered in class.
