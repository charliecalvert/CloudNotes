## Description

Angular Mongo Test in class.

**NOTE**: *I've noticed a few of you are using the git bash command prompt rather than the Windows Command Prompt. If you truly are more comfortable using bash instead of the Windows Command Prompt, then please continue, but if you don't have a strong preference, I think you will find it easier to use the Windows Command Prompt. I think bash is better than the Windows command prompt, but it is meant to be run with Linux, and trying to get it to work on Windows can be a struggle.*

## Step One

Create the base project by making a copy of **AngularMongoCrud**:

```    
set SKIP=D:\Git\prog219-calvert\Week05-AngularMongoCrud\.idea
robocopy Week05-AngularMongoCrud Week05-AngularMongoTest /XD %SKIP% /MIR
```

This is a bit artificial. We would normally have just one project and add our tests to it. But I need to grade your work, and the simplest way for me to do that is to have you start a completely new project at each stage. If we were really confident of our Git skills we could use tags and branches, but let's not rely on that quite yet.

## Step Two

Install [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.3/introduction.html "Jasmine").

Run the following command to install yeoman generator for Jasmine. You
only need to do it once:

	npm install -g generator-jasmine

At the root of your project, type **yo jasmine**. This creates a folder called **test** with this structure:

```
test/
test/.bowerrc
test/.bower.json
test/index.html
test/spec
test/spec/test.js
test/bower_components
test/bower_components/jasmine/*
```

There are multiple files in the jasmine folder. I indicated that fact with an asterisk.

Unfortunately, the copy of Jasmine that yo installs is ancient, and of interest primarily to biblical scholars who want to reinterpret .  To fix things up, do the following:

- Open **test/bower.json** and set the version of jasmine to 2.3.0
- Run **bower install**
- Open up **test/index.html**
- Around line 10, add code to load **boot.js**

Code to load **boot.js** looks like this:

```
<script src="bower_components/jasmine/lib/jasmine-core/boot.js"></script>
```

Delete this entire section, which begins around line 16:

```
        <script>
            (function() {
                var jasmineEnv = jasmine.getEnv();
                jasmineEnv.updateInterval = 1000;
                var htmlReporter = new jasmine.HtmlReporter();
                jasmineEnv.addReporter(htmlReporter);
                jasmineEnv.specFilter = function(spec) {
                    return htmlReporter.specFilter(spec);
                };
                var currentWindowOnload = window.onload;
                window.onload = function() {
                    if (currentWindowOnload) {
                        currentWindowOnload();
                    }
                    execJasmine();
                };
                function execJasmine() {
                    jasmineEnv.execute();
                }
            })();
        </script>
```
When you are done, **index.html** might look something like this:

```
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Jasmine Spec Runner</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/jasmine/lib/jasmine-core/jasmine.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="bower_components/jasmine/lib/jasmine-core/jasmine.js"></script>
        <script src="bower_components/jasmine/lib/jasmine-core/jasmine-html.js"></script>
        <script src="bower_components/jasmine/lib/jasmine-core/boot.js"></script>

        <!-- include source files here... -->

        <!-- include spec files here... -->
        <script src="spec/test.js"></script>

    </body>
</html>
``` 

## Step Three

Good luck, Charlie prefers **chai**, but is having trouble getting it to integrate with Jasmine. Please skip this step. 

Information about chai is [available on Elvenware](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/web/UnitTests/Mocha.html#chai).

## Step Four

It is now time to start testing our program.

First load into **index.html** Angular and the code you want to test:

```
<!-- include source files here... -->
<script src="../public/components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script src="../public/components/angular-mocks/angular-mocks.js"></script>
<script src="../public/javascripts/resources.js"></script>
<script src="../public/javascripts/control.js"></script>
```

Add this code beneath the word **describe** and above your first test:

```
		var MyController, scope;
		
        beforeEach(module('elvenApp'));

        // Initialize the controller and a mock scope
        beforeEach(inject(function ($controller, $rootScope) {
            scope = $rootScope.$new();
            MyController = $controller('MyController', {
                $scope: scope
            });
        }));
```

Now add in a real test of your object:

```
  it('should get a hint', function() {
     expect(scope.hint.length).toEqual(78);
  });
```

Do what you need to do to set up your mock object in resources.js:

```
angular.module('pres', [])
    .constant('CONFIG', {
        DB_NAME: 'elvenlab01',
        COLLECTION: 'scientists',
        API_KEY: 'qfSxFoUGHBA1EuUlqhux_op2fy6oF_wy'
    })
    .factory('scientists', function (CONFIG) {
        console.log('Scientists factory called');

   function scientists() {

   }

   scientists.prototype.query = function() {
      return [{firstName: 'Marie', lastName: 'Curie', subject: 'Radiation'}];
   };
	return new scientists();
```

We can modify the above further by removing the constant we named **CONFIG**. This constant is needed if we want to access MongoDb, but it serves no purpose in this mock object:

```
angular.module('pres', [])
    .factory('scientists', function () {
        console.log('Scientists factory called');

        function scientists() {

        }

        scientists.prototype.query = function() {
            return [{firstName: 'Marie', lastName: 'Curie', subject: 'Radiation'}];
        };

        // CODE OMITTED HERE

	return new scientists();
   });
```

Then run this test:

```
    it('should get a database hit', function() {
            scope.loadScientists();
            expect(scope.scientists[0].firstName).toEqual('Marie');
    });
```

## Step Five 

Grunt and jshint. Get them to run, get them to come back clean. Please note that **[jshint][jsh]** is as close as JavaScript is going to come to having static type checking outside of actually using something like TypeScript. If you like static type checking, you might well find **jshint** helpful.

Vaguely defined details are [here][gruntyo].

We'll talk about constructor names and capitalization on Monday or sometime soon.

## Turn it in

Be sure your code is in the **Week05-AngularMongoTest** folder of your repository. Check it in and push the submit button for the assignment, adding comments as usual or as needed.
