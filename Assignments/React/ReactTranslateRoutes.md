## Overview

The goal of this assignment is to everyone more practice with with React and Express routes. These are subjects we have to know cold. Perhaps the only way to learn is to practice over and over. There is no Redux in this assignment.

I will give you working code that uses both straight Plain Old JavaScript and jQuery. In particular, there will be two files that do the same thing, one with jQuery, one with JavaScript.

The goal will be to translate the code to use React, with minor changes.

## React Guidelines

You will create four React components.

```html
<h2>Simple Get Nine</h2>

    <p id="getNineResult">Get Nine Result will be placed here.</p>

<a id="getNine" class="button elf">Get Nine</a>
```
