# Address Component

The goal is to extend our **week02-react-jest** project to support new React components with **props**.

**NOTE**: _In many cases, my assignments are not simply cut and paste exercises. In my code I might write something like **etc...** or **and so on...** or **You write the code**. In these cases I expect you to complete the code as an exercise. I usually create sections like these by cutting and pasting working code into assignment, and then delete the parts I want readers to complete. Though I try to avoid it, there are places where I leave something out without explicitly making clear that you need to write some code on your own. In any case, you are responsible for creating assignments that compile cleanly and perform specific actions outlined in these assignments._

## Goals

Here are the core goals of this assignment.

- [Tag](#tag) your work
- Create the **components** folder and put in it a file called **Address.js**. This file should be based on **App.js**
- Remove code from **Address.js** that **does not** have to do with addresses
- Remove code from **App.js** that has to do with addresses
- **import** your **Address** component into **index.js**. Use it in **ReactDOM.render**.
- Create **address-list.js** with sample addresses in it
- In **App.js** pass the addresses from **address-list** to **Address** as props
- Consume props in **Address**
- Switch from record 0 to record 1 of the address list.
- Get tests working

## Use Git to Tag Your Project {#tag}

Since we are often working on a single project that is implemented in multiple phases, I suggest creating a git tag marking the current status of your project:

```bash
$ git tag -a v3.0.0 -m "Start Week03"
$ git push origin v3.0.0
$ git tag -n1
```

The first command creates a tag that has a message associated with it. The message works much like the message in a commit.

The second command pushes the tag from your local machine to the cloud.

The last command lists your tags and their message on one line. If you have only a single tag, it is not particularly useful, but once you have multiple tags you will see how helpful this can be. Increase the value of the number after -n? to see more information about your tag. You can read about tags here:

- [Git docs on tagging][gittag]

## Create Address Component

In Webstorm:

* Create an empty **src/components** directory.
* Create an an empty **src/components/Address.js**. (Now components is no longer empty.)

## Define Address

Block copy the contents of **App.js** into **Address.js**.

* Rename the class from **App** to **Address**. At the bottom of the file, export **Address** rather than **App**.

The result, should include code that looks like this:

```JavaScript
imports ...

class Address extends Component { ... }

export default Address;
```

Get rid of anything that is not directly associated with the idea of defining an address.

* Inside **Address.js** Remove references **state.file** and **getFile** from the **constructor** and **render** methods and from anywhere else you find them. Leave the tests alone. We are just editing **Address.js** in this step.
* Remove the **header** section from **render**.
* Remove the default paragraph about editing App.js generated by **create-react-app**: This is the text that reads: "To get started, edit...".
* Remove imports that are no longer needed such as **logo.svg**.

## Clean Up App.js

In **App.js** do the mirror image of what you did in **Address.js**: remove all references to an address from the **constructor** and **render** methods, etc.

Preserve the header section for now, but remove the default text that begins "To get started, edit...".

Move **App.js** into the **components** directory.

![Components Dir in Webstorm][cdiw]

This display in Webstorm can be a bit confusing. Note that **App.css**, **App.test.js**, etc are in **src**, not in **src/components**. The only files in the **src/components** directory at this stage are **Address.js** and **App.js**.

## Add Address to our Main File {#add-address}

The next step is to display our new **Address** component. There are several ways to achieve this goal. One of the simplest is to render it in **index.js**. To do this, we will need to:

- **import** our **Address** component,
- Add a **DIV** to our **render** method
- Display the **Address** component by adding its tag to the **DIV**

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App'; <=== MODIFY THIS LINE ==<
import Address from './components/Address'
import './index.css';

ReactDOM.render(
    <div>
        <App />
        <Address/>
    </div>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

There is one further change you will need to make this file. I don't spell it explicitly, but I give you a strong hint about where to make the change. It is up to your modify the line and get your code running without error.


## Clean up Relative Paths

Other changes, such as correcting the paths to **App.css** and **logo.svg** in the files moved to the components directory are left as an exercise. If you don't yet understand relative paths, read about them here:

- [Relative Paths JavaScript][rpsj]
- [Sadly W3Schools provides a simply example][rpw3s]
- [Relative Paths][rps]

**NOTE**: _Remember to open up the Browser debugger (Developer Tools), usually with F12, to check for any errors._

Here is a sample error you might get if you do not have the relative paths set up correctly:

```bash
./src/components/Address.js
Module not found: Cannot resolve './App.css' in '/home/charlie/Git/prog272-calvert-2018/AddressComponent/src/components'
```

Use an HR element at the bottom of the render method for **App.js** to help separate the two components.

## Address List

Let's create a simple file called **src/address-list.js** that contains two addresses:

```javascript
const unknown = 'unknown';
const addresses = [
    {
        firstName: unknown,
        lastName: unknown,
        address: unknown,
        city: unknown,
        state: unknown,
        zip: unknown,
        phone: unknown,
        fax: unknown,
        tollfree: unknown
    },
    {
        firstName: 'Patty',
        lastName: 'Murray',
        address: '154 Russell Senate Office Building',
        city: 'Washington',
        state: 'D.C.',
        zip: '20510',
        phone: '(202) 224-2621',
        fax: '(202) 224-0238',
        tollfree: '(866) 481-9186'
    }

];

export default addresses;
```

## Pass addresses to Address {#addresses}

Use **props** to pass **address** list to **Address**. First link in both our **Address** component and the **address-list**:

```javascript
import Address from './components/Address'
import addresses from './address-list';
```
Now pass the **address-list** to the **Address** component:

```javascript
<Address addressList={addresses} />
```

Altogether, it looks like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import Address from './components/Address'
import addresses from './address-list';
import './index.css';

ReactDOM.render(
    <div>
        <App />
        <Address addressList={addresses} />
    </div>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Think of it this way. In **index.js**, at this stage, we are instantiating two components called **App** and **Address** and we are setting the props for the **Address** component:

```html
<div>
    <App/>  <== This instantiates our App component
    <Address addressList={addressList}/>
</div>
```

Focus on this one line from the code fragment show above:

```html
<Address addressList={addressList}/>
```

It does two things:

- Instantiates **Address**
- Sets the **props** for the **Address** component.

That means that our **Address** component can access the values from **address-list.js** files as **props**:

```
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log(this.props.addressList)
}    
```

## Consume props {#props-in-address}

We don't want the **Address** component to be responsible for updating the **address-list**. It is an anti-pattern for a component to update it's own properties.

**Address** does not own the **addressList**. Right now, it is owned by **index.js** and so only **index.js** should change it. **AddressShow** only consumes **address_list** as **props**. We will set things up so the **Address** component can register changes to its **state**, but ultimately it will pass the changes back up the line and let some other component handle updating the **address-list**.

In the **Address** component, we need to consume the **address-list** passed in **props**. Let's just copy it into our state:

```javascript
constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    console.log('ADDRESS PROPS', typeof this.props);
    const address = this.props.addressList[0];
    this.state = {
        firstName: address.firstName,
        lastName: address.lastName,
        address: address.address,
        city: address.city,
        state: address.state,
        zip: address.zip,
        phone: address.phone,
        fax: address.fax,
        tollfree: address.tollfree,
        website: address.website
    }

}
```

We grab the first item in the **address-list** array and use it to initialize our state.

## Display State

We don't need to change our **render** method, but we do need to change what we display as our current **state** when the user clicks our **button**. Since we are only part way to our solution, we will simply get the second item in **address-list**, and display it to the user.

Note that the constructor gets the first item, this method gets the second item. This helps you see how the system works, but does not fully explain how our code will work in the long run.

```javascript
setAddress = () => {
    const address = this.props.addressList[1];

    this.setState({
          firstName: address.firstName,
          lastName: address.lastName,
          address: address.address,
          city: address.city,
          state: address.state,
          zip: address.zip,
          phone: address.phone,
          fax: address.fax,
          tollfree: address.tollfree,
          website: address.website
      })    
};
```

Note that we are violating DRY. There are two chunks of code, one in the constructor, one here, that are identical. How can that be fixed?

## Create Header Component

For extra credit, you can move the **header** element from **App.js** into a new file called **components/Header.js**.

- Create an empty file called **components/Header.js**
- Copy the contents of App.js into it.
- Remove everything but the render method and the Header:
- Remove the **header** from App.js

Here is the complete declaration for the **Header** **class**.
```JavaScript
import...

class Header extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="App">
                <header className="App-header">
                    <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo"/>
                    <h2 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h2>
                </header>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export...
```

Now add the Header into **index.js**. This will involve adding a new import and adding a new element into the DIV.

![Header in components][hic]

## Tests

As you refactor your components, your tests might need to change. For instance, if you move the **H2** for your app into **components/Header.js**, you might need to change your tests. Consider this code:

```javascript
import App from './App';

// Code omitted here

it.only('renders and reads H2 text', () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(<App />);
    const welcome = <h2>Welcome to React</h2>;
    expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toEqual(true);
});
```

It will likely end up like this:

```javascript
import Header from './components/Header';

// Code omitted here

it.only('renders and reads H1 text', () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(<Header />);
    const welcome = <h2>Welcome to React</h2>;
    expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toEqual(true);
});
```

If you want to start to test the Address component, remember that it expects to be passed some **props**. You already saw how to do this in the main program. Simple import the **address-list.js** file, and then use it when you instantiate an instance of that component.

**NOTE**: _I'm intentionally leaving out some detail here to make you did a bit of thinking on your own._

## Refactor Tests

Just as you refactored your components into two modules called **App.js** and **Address.js**, you should also refactor your tests into:

- **src/App.test.js**: All tests related to the **App** component
- **src/Address.test.js**: All tests related to the **Address** component

This will require a bit of cut and pasting, but it should not be overly difficult.

![Refactor tests Header, Address and App][rfth]

## Describe Tests

Make sure you uniquely describe each suite of tests:

```javascript
describe('Jest Address Tests', function () { ... })

describe('Jest App Tests', function () { ... })
```

Here I **describe** one suite as being for the **Address** component and one for the **App** component.

Include a string that describes your individual test suites:

```JavaScript
describe('Address tests', function () {

  // YOUR TESTS HERE

});
```

Your other module might use the string **App tests**.


## Debug Jest Message

As we start writing more complex tests, we want to create some methods that will help us debug them. In particular, we want to use the Enzyme [debug][edb], [find][efind] and [childAt][eca] methods.

[edb]: http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ShallowWrapper/debug.html
[efind]: http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ShallowWrapper/find.html
[eca]: http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ShallowWrapper/childAt.html

```javascript
const getLast = (wrapper, element) => {
    const ninep = wrapper.find(element).last().debug();
    console.log(ninep);
};

const getFirst = (wrapper, element) => {
    const ninep = wrapper.find(element).first().debug();
    console.log(ninep);
};

const getChild = (wrapper, element, index) => {
    const lastParagraph = wrapper.find(element).childAt(index).debug();
    console.log(lastParagraph);
};
```

Call it like this:

```javascript
it.only('renders and reads H2 text', () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(<App />);
    getFirst(wrapper, 'h1');
    const welcome = <h2>Welcome to React</h2>;
    expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toEqual(true);
});
```

Or like this, if you want something a bit more flexible. The important difference is that it has the **quiet** option, but not that this one goes after h2 instead of **P**:

```javascript
   var quiet = false;

   const getLast = (wrapper, element) => {
     const lastParagraph = wrapper.find(element).last().debug();
     if (!quiet) {
       console.log(lastParagraph);
     }
 };

 const getFirst = (wrapper, element) => {
     const firstParagraph = wrapper.find(element).first().debug();
     if (!quiet) {
       console.log(firstParagraph);
     }
 };

 const getChild = (wrapper, element, index) => {
     const indexedParagraph = wrapper.find(element).childAt(index).debug();
     if (!quiet) {
        console.log(indexedParagraph);
     }
 };

```

Then change **quiet** to true to suppress the strings.

## Turn it in

Make sure your code runs and tests work. Commit your work, push. Tell me where to look for program.

Your tests might look a bit like this:

![Final Tests][test-final]

[test-final]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket01.elvenware.com/images/address-component-charlie-tests.png


## Simple Test

Sometimes it seems all my tests are failing and I don't know if the problem is in the logic of my tests, or in the way I have set up my tests. In cases like that, I want to find a way to ensure that I have at least one test that will definitely pass. If that "unbreakable" test fails, then the problem is not the logic of any particular test, but in the setup or syntax of my tests. Here is my test that "cannot fail":

```javascript
fit('proves we can run a test', () => {
  expect(true).toBe(true);
});
```

**true** should always be **true**, so if this test fails, or our tests won't run at all, the problem is not the logic of the test itself, but the way we have set up our test.

**Note**: _I am using **fit** to ensure that only this one test in my current test module is run. After I can confirm that this test passes, then I might change **fit** to **it** or add **fit** to the next test in the module_.

## Enzyme Dreams

Enzyme can help you see the output generated by your JSX. Suppose you have this JSX in your React Component:

```
<p className="App-intro">
    tollfree: {this.state.tollfree}
</p>
```

Then Enzyme can produce output like this to show what your JSX translates to at runtime:

```
<p className="App-intro">
  tollfree:
  unknown
</p>
```

The enzyme code that generates this output might look a bit like this:

```
const welcome = <p className="App-intro">tollfree: unknown</p>;
const lastParagraph = wrapper.find('div').childAt(10).debug();
console.log(lastParagraph);
expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toEqual(true);
```

The wrapper contains all the HTML from your project. See it like this:

```
console.log(wrapper.debug();
```

But the childAt code above finds one node, one paragraph element, in that DOM array of elements, and displays its content.

```
<p className="App-intro">
  tollfree:
  unknown
</p>
```
