# GistManager

I've moved this into a file called [Isit322Final2017.html][isit-final]

[isit-final]: http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/MidtermFinal/Isit322Final2017.html

**NOTE**: _The GistManager assignment will be deleted in the next day or two. What matters now is the final._
