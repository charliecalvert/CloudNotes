StackEdit and DropBox
=====================

At least a rough outline of this assignment is now complete. I may fill in a few more details of this assignment later.

Overview
--------

Complete the following steps:

- If you have not done so already, [create a DropBox account](https://db.tt/6ZfOwOQg).
- Using the tools in StackEdit, save the document you created in the **StackGoogle** assignment to DropBox.
- Install DropBox on Linux

Details
-------

There are several different ways to install DropBox on Linux. Some of the simplest, and safest, are outlined here:

- [DropBox on Elvenware](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/DropBox.html#install)

After installing Dropbox, prepare a screenshot like the one shown below.

The image shown above depicts a listing (ls -la) of the **$HOME/.dropbox** folder. I want you to take a similar screenshot, but of the **.dropbox-dist** folder. Here is how to get the listing I want to see:

    ls -la $HOME/.dropbox-dist

Looking at the image shown above, you can see the dropbox icon near the bottom right:

Make sure this icon is visible in your screenshot.

Save Your File to Dropbox
--------------------------

In your Dropbox folder on Linux, create a sub-folder called StackEdit. This is where you will place documents that you create in StackEdit.

In StackEdit, choose the pound sign icon on the far left. In the **Synchronize** section, choose **Synchronize | Dropbox | Export to Dropbox**. A dialog like the one shown below appears.

Choose to save you file in your **StackEdit** folder as
**Week05-StackBox-LastName.md**, where LastName is your last name.
Use a graphical file browser such **PCManFM** to view your StackEdit
folder. In Lubuntu, you can access this tool from **Start | Accessories |
File Manager PCManFM**. Take a screenshot of your StackEdit folder.
It should look a bit like the one shown below.

Turn It In
----------

Submit the various screensheets you created following the instructions outlined above.
