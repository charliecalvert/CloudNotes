## Overview

This is a (still in progress) description of the Fall, 2016, final for Prog270.

## Basics

Complete the following:

- A web site on EC2 that includes:
  - Your midterm project (At least seven pages with images on some pages.)
  - The Walking Map
  - The Presidents Database
  - A link to Wordpress blog, which also runs on EC2
- A Firebase site that includes
  - Your midterm project (At least seven pages with images on some pages.)
  - Sign in with Google
  - Database features including
    - The "chat program" that works that updates automatically
    - The "Presidents Database" that lets you add first names and last names.

Use the FinalPrep assignments (Firebase, WordPress) as guides to what is included.

Have different index.html (home pages) for your EC2 and Firebase sites. Have some kind of script that helps automate all this.

Put your code for both sites in your repository.


## Turn it in

Supply links to your EC2 and Firebase Sites.
