# Overview

Learn to use Hangouts

## Basics

You will need to have a Google account.

Use Chrome or Chromium. Log into your account.

- Open the Settings menu for Chrome. (This is the Hamburger menu on upper right.)
  - Or go to this URL: **chrome://settings/**
- Choose **Bookmarks | Show Bookmark Bar**. (Ctrl + Shift + B)
- Click the little **Show Apps** icon on the far left of the Bookmarks bar.
- Go to the WebStore and install [Hangouts][ho].

Then send me a message using the address I gave you in class.

## Video

We are going to want to share our screens. In particular, you will need to see my screen. Before we can share our screens we need to enter a video conversation. But you do not need to have a webcam. You should, however, have a microphone. Most laptops have both. Check, however, that you don't have your camera somehow turned off.

## Turn it in

Send me at least one message via hangouts. When you turn in (submit) the assignment with Canvas, tell me the user name you used when you sent the message. If I can find a message from you in hangouts then all is good.
