# Code Academy Part II

Bring both [Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
and [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) to 50%.

When you are done, submit a screen shot of your progress. If you jumped ahead, and completed 100% of a Skill, then submit a link to your Code Academy **profile page**,

**Please note**: *You must link to your profile page. Don't just link to some random page on CodeAcademy. The assignment can be graded only if you turn in a link to your profile page!*

If you have not yet completed a particular skill by finishing 100% of the questions, can you please submit a screen shot of the skills you have completed. It will probably look something like this:

**NOTE**: _You can see an icon or a picture of yourself in the upper right hand corner of the Code Academy site. Click that picture, there you will find a way to get your profile page._
