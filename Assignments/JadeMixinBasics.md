# Jade Mixin Basics

The goal of this assignment is to learn how to use Jade [mixins](https://pugjs.org/language/mixins.html). In particular, we will see how to use mixins to quickly and easily assemble an interface for an application.

The assignment also reviews creating forms and retrieving data from forms with jQuery.

- Slides on Jade Mixins: [http://bit.ly/jade-mixins](http://bit.ly/jade-mixins)

## Create Project

Use **CreateExpressProject** to create **Week05-JadeMixinBasics**.

Copy in the mixins:

```bash
cp $ELF_TEMPLATES/JadeMixins/jade/mixin-radios.jade views/.
cp $ELF_TEMPLATES/JadeMixins/jade/mixins.jade views/.
cp $ELF_TEMPLATES/JadeMixins/jade/mixin-inputs.jade views/.
```

Or:

```bash
cp $ELF_TEMPLATES/JadeMixins/pug/mixin-radios.pug views/.
cp $ELF_TEMPLATES/JadeMixins/pug/mixins.pug views/.
cp $ELF_TEMPLATES/JadeMixins/pug/mixin-inputs.pug views/.
```

**NOTE**: *We might not use the second file, **mixins.jade**, but I will include if for now in case we need it later.*

**TIP**: *I've saved the above commands to **$JSOBJECTS/Utilities/NodeInstall/GetMixins**. You could copy that file to your **~/bin** directory.*

## The Code

Below we set up an event that will be called when the user clicks on the **submit** button:

```javascript

$(document).ready(function() { 'use strict';
    $("#target").submit(function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        var userFormData = $(this).serialize();
        $('#formResults').html(userFormData);
    });
});
```

The id **target** is associated with the form itself:

```html
<form id="target">
```

The submit button is declared like this:

```
Jade:
	input.btn.btn-primary(type="submit", value="Go")

HTML:
	<input value="Go" class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">
```

When the button is clicked the jQuery [submit]() method is triggered. We use the jQuery **serialize** method to retrieve the user's selections from the form.


## The Main Page

The Jade for our main page is quite simple because of our mixins. There are three mixins that we focus on in this assignments:

* **formPanel**: Bootstrap panel with a form
* **elfPanel**: Generic Bootstrap panel
* **elfCheckBox**: Create a check box
* **radioPanel**: Panel for radio buttons
* **elfRadio**: Create a radio button

You can see the source for these files here:

* **$ELF_TEMPLATES/JadeMixins/**

The following is the complete code listing for **views/index.jade**:

```jade
extends layout
include mixin-radios
include mixin-inputs

block append content

    .container
        h1 #{pageTitle}

        p You are in the <strong>#{programTitle}</strong> program. Select some controls and press the Go button.

        +elfFormPanel("Main Form")#target

            +elfRadioPanel("Radio Buttons")
                +elfRadio("Radio1", "option1")
                +elfRadio("Radio2", "option2")

            +elfPanel("CheckBoxes")
                +elfCheckBox("CheckBox 01", "checkBox01", "checkBox01")#checkBox01
                +elfCheckBox("CheckBox 02", "checkBox02", "checkBox02")#checkBox02

            +elfPanel("Input")
                +elfInput("Enter a name", "subject", "Enter a subject")#subject.form-control

            +elfPanel("Actions")
                input.btn.btn-primary(type="submit", value="Go")

        div
            pre#formResults


```

Also put this code in **routes/index.js**, updating the already existing method:

```
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) { 'use strict';
  res.render('index', { pageTitle: 'Main Page',
        programTitle: 'Week05-JadeMixinBasics'});
});
```

## A Second Program

Now that you have the rhythm, create a second program called **Week05-SecondMixin** with:

- Three **elfCheckboxes** in an **elfPanel**
	- Kurosawa
	- Tolstoy
	- Mifune
- Five **elfRadio** Buttons in a **elfRadioPanel**. Name them:
	- Seven Samurai
	- Ran
	- Rashomon
	- High and Low
	- Ikiru
- An **elfInput** control in an elfPanel
- A submit button in a elfPanel

Create a screen shot to show that the submit button works. That is, that it can be used to display the user's selections in **pre#formResults**.

## Turn it in

In both programs, select a radio button, at least two check boxes. Enter text in the input control. Press the **submit** button. For each program, take a screen shot showing that the contents of the form selections are displayed in **pre#formResults**.

Attach your screen shots to the assignment and place your work in the folders designated above and turn in as usual.
