## Overview

Study the Elvenware Browsers page:

- [http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/Browsers.html](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/Browsers.html)

In particular, look at this section:

- [Google Clickable URLS][clickable]

## Turn it in

Compose clickable Google URLS [like those][clickable] referenced above. Put them on the Canvas Text page. When clicked, they should take me to Google search site (google.com) and show:

- Sites related to stackoverflow.com
- Sites related to codecademy.com
- JavaScript sites that do not include the words jQuery or Angular
- Pages about jQuery appearing only on Elvenware.com.
- Sites about **Washington** that do not include references to **Washington DC**. Don't use the word **State** in your query.
