## Description

Our goals are two fold:

- Create an application that can either use:
    -  a mock **SimpleScienceData** object 
    -  the Mongo based  **ScienceResource** object.
- Show how to use ExpressRoutes to retrieve HTML
    - And dynamically insert the results into our documents
- Appending methods dynamically to an existing object.
    - We add new methods to the objects in our array of data
- Show how to use ControllerAs in a **directive**
- Learn more about querying with the **$resource** object and its custom URLs.
- Mostly for fun, but also because it can be useful during development, lets have some of our tests be part of the our running program.

## Step One

Download the [starter project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B25UTAlOfPRGSTNRRk5qVkF1eTg/view?usp=sharing).

Note that it is similar to the project we used on Monday but we have renamed some methods in ScienceFacade to bring them in line with the Angular $resource object that uses MongoDb. In the list below, the original method name is on the left and the new name on the right: 

- getAll -> query
- delete -> remove
- update -> updateDocument

We have also added a method called **assignMethods**. Its purpose is to ensure that each list we create has certain methods available on it. Again, we do this to maintain compatibility with Angular resource. 

A few additional changes were made.

## Step Two 

Routing

When we send a request from the client back to the server, it is routed to the appropriate method using the **express Router**. See, for instance, **routes/index.js**. Place the following in **index.js**:

```
router.get('/:id', function(req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.params.id);
  res.render('ScienceInfo/' + req.params.id, { title: req.params.id });
});

``` 

Create a new folder called: **views/ScienceInfo**. Place three files in it:

astronomy.jade:

```
h1 Astronomy

p Astronomy is a subject
```

physics.jade:

```
h1 Physics

p Physics is a subject
```

radioactivity.jade:

```
h1 Radioactivity

p Radioactivity is a subject
```

We can see the result of our new route by entering the following URL in our browser:

    localhost:30025/astronomy
    localhost:30025/physics
    localhost:30025/radioactivity 

In order to invoke those routes from our program, we place the following method in our controller:

```
        myController.loadDocument = function() {
            $http.get('/' + myController.subject.toLowerCase())
                .success(function(document, status, headers, config) {
                    myController.document = $sce.trustAsHtml(document);
                })
                .error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
                    alert("Somethings wrong")
                });
        }
```

The above code uses the angular **$http.get** method to send the request to the server. This is known as **ajax**. The method has parallel in **jquery** called **$.ajax**.

In our controller, you should call **loadDocument** at the end of the callback found in **loadScientists** and at the end of **indexChange**. In other words, when those two functions are called, they should ensure that loadDocument is called. This way we can see the document associate with each of our scientists.

## Step Three

The **directive**.

Appended at the bottom of **Control.js**: 

```
    app.directive('elfMarie', function(scientists) {
        return {
            controller: 'MyController',
            controllerAs: 'myController',
            template:
            'First: {{myController.marie.firstName}} ' +
            '<br>Last: {{myController.marie.lastName}}' +
            '<br>City: {{myController.marie.subject}}'
        };
    });
 ```

## Step Four

The latest version of MongoDb Angular Resource. Put it in the **public/javascripts** folder and name it **ScienceResource.js**. (In MongoCrud, we called it **resource.js**. We have refactored the name, and modified it slightly. In particular we added the **getTopic** method.)

```
angular.module('Science', ['ngResource'])

    .constant('CONFIG', {
        DB_NAME: 'elvenlab01',
        COLLECTION: 'scientists',
        API_KEY: 'qfSxFoUGHBA1EuUlqhux_op2fy6oF_wy'
    })

    .factory('scientists', function ($resource, CONFIG) {
        console.log('Scientists factory called');

        var scientists = $resource(
            'https://api.mongolab.com/api/1/databases/' + CONFIG.DB_NAME +
            '/collections/' + CONFIG.COLLECTION + '/:id', {
                apiKey: CONFIG.API_KEY
            },
            {
                update: {method: 'PUT'}
            });

        scientists.prototype.getTopic = function(firstNameToFind, callback) {
            bar = $resource(
                'https://api.mongolab.com/api/1/databases/' + CONFIG.DB_NAME +
                '/collections/' + CONFIG.COLLECTION, {
                    apiKey: CONFIG.API_KEY,
                    q: {"firstName": firstNameToFind }
                });
            return bar.query({}, callback);
        };

        scientists.prototype.getFirstName = function () {
            return this.firstName;
        };

        scientists.prototype.getLastName = function () {
            return this.lastName;
        };

        scientists.prototype.getSubject = function () {
            return this.subject;
        };


        scientists.prototype.add = function(newData, callback) {
            var scientistResource = new scientists(newData);
            scientistResource.$save(callback);
        };

        scientists.prototype.updateDocument = function (successCallback, errorCallback) {
            console.log("update called");
            var idObject = {id: this._id.$oid};
            var updateData = angular.extend({}, this, {_id:undefined});
            scientists.update(
                idObject,
                updateData,
                successCallback,
                errorCallback);
        };

        scientists.prototype.remove = function (successCallback, errorCallback) {
            scientists.remove({id:this._id.$oid}, successCallback, errorCallback);
        };

        return scientists;
    });
```

## Step Five

Now lets test dependency injection. In **layout.js**, swap out

## Discussion

Notice the call to getTopic:

```
   scientists.prototype.getTopic = function(firstNameToFind, callback) {
       bar = $resource(
            'https://api.mongolab.com/api/1/databases/' + CONFIG.DB_NAME +
            '/collections/' + CONFIG.COLLECTION, {
                 apiKey: CONFIG.API_KEY,
                 q: {"firstName": firstNameToFind }
             }
     );
     return bar.query({}, callback);
```
