## Overview

If you have not done so already, create a Google shared folder we can use in this class.

Complete only the **Google Shared Folder** and **Google Document** portions of the [Online Presence][op] assignment. I don't care what you place in the Google document, but do create a document called OnlinePresence. Your folder should be named something like:

- 2016-Isi322-LastName

[op]:http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/OnlinePresence.html#google

## Turn it in

Just submit something and I will look for your folder.
