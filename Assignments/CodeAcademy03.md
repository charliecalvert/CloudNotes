# Code Academy Part III

Bring the JavaScript and HTML courses to 38%.

- [Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
- [Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

When you are done, submit a screen shot of your progress. If you are completely done with the Skill, then submit a link to your Code Academy **profile page**, like this:

- <http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536>

**Please note**: *You must link to your profile page. Don't just link to some random page on CodeAcademy. The assignment can be graded only if you turn in a link to your profile page! There is an icon at the top right of the Code Academy site that should lead to your profile.*

Their change made it so that I can see only your completed skills. If you have not yet completed a particular skill by finishing 100% of the questions, please submit a screen shot of the skills you have completed. It will probably look something like this:
