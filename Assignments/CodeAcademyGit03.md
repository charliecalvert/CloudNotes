# Code Academy Part III

Bring both [Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
and [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) to at least 75%.

When you are done, submit a screen shot of your progress. If you are completely done with the Skill, then submit a link to your Code Academy **profile page**,
like this:

- <http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536>

**Please note**: *You must link to your profile page. Don't just link to some random page on CodeAcademy. The assignment can be graded only if you turn in a link to your profile page!*

In July, 2014 Code Academy changed their profile pages so that I will not be able to see your progress through a particular skill by looking at your profile page. Their change made it so that I can see only your completed skills. If you have not yet completed a particular skill by finishing 100% of the questions, please submit a screen shot of the skills you have completed. It will probably look something like this:

**NOTE**: _You can see an icon or a picture of yourself in the upper right hand corner of the Code Academy site. Click that picture, there you will find a way to get your profile page._
