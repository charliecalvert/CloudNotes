# New Git Bucket

See the [GitNewRepo][git-new-repo] assignment which is more complete than this.

[git-new-repo]: http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/GitNewRepo.html


Use [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) to host a private git repository. You have two choices:

- Create a new BitBucket account if you don't have one already
- Use an existing BitBucket account.

In the account, create a new repository. Name your git repository like this:

- isit322_lastname

For instance:

- isit322_calvert

Make sure you give me read/write access to it. Use the send invitation link and use ccalvert as my id.

And most important, include a **.gitignore** with, at minimum, the following items in it:

```
node_modules
.metadata
.idea
Thumbs.db
```

This video shows how to proceed:

## Step by Step Overview

- Create Bitbucket account if necessary
- Push create button
- Name: prog272_lastname
- Options: private, git, wiki, javascript
- Push create repository button

Follow the instructions in "I'm starting from scratch" using the video as a guide to a few slight variations such as creating the **.gitignore** file with at least node_modules in it.

When you are done, on the overview page choose send invitation, type in **ccalvert** and give me read write privileges.

## Turn it in

Please include the URL of your repository when you post this assignment in Canvas.
