# Prog 272 2015 Simplified Final

I want to give you the opportunity to complete a simplified final. To
complete this final, you must complete Route Parameters and Cordova
Various Plugins. These are steps six and seven of the final.
 
 
 - [Route Parameters](http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/RouteParameters.html)
 - [Cordova Various Plugins](http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/CordovaVariousPlugins.html)
 - [The final](http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/Prog272Final2015.html)
 
Please look at this updated **Turn it in** section for Cordova Various
Plugins. You must complete this step to get credit for the simplified
final:
 
 - [Turn it in](http://www.ccalvert.net/books/CloudNotes/Assignments/CordovaVariousPlugins.html#turn-it-in)
 
Then in Week12Final folder, create a default Cordova application.
It does not need to do anything. It can simply have the default icon
on it. I just want to see that you can create a default Cordova
program. If you can do more than that, then great, but that would 
be sufficient to get you through this final.
