# Code Academy Part VI

Bring the JavaScript and HTML courses to 75%.

- [Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
- [Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

When you are done, submit either a screen shot, or if you are at 100%, a link to your Code Academy **profile page**, like this:

- <http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536>

Remember, not just any page for the link, but a link to your profile page. There is an icon at the top right of the Code Academy site that should lead to your profile.
