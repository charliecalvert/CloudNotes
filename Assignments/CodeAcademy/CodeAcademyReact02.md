# Code Academy Part II

Bring [React Part 1](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101) to at least 50%.

When you are done, submit a screen shot of your progress. If you jumped ahead, and completed 100% of a Skill, then submit a link to your Code Academy **profile page**,
like this:

- <http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536>

**Please note**: *You must link to your profile page. Don't just link to some random page on CodeAcademy. The assignment can be graded only if you turn in a link to your profile page!*

In July, 2014 CodeAcademy changed their profile pages so that I will not be able to see your progress through a particular skill by looking at your profile page. Their change made it so that I can see only your completed skills. If you have not yet completed a particular skill by finishing 100% of the questions, can you please submit a screen shot of the skills you have completed. It will probably look something like this:

**NOTE**: _You can see an icon or a picture of yourself in the upper right hand corner of the Code Academy site. Click that picture, there you will find a way to get your profile page._
