# Code Academy Part IV

Bring [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) and [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) to 100%.

When you have reached 100%, submit a link to your Code Academy **profile page**, like this:

- <http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536>

**Remember, not just any page for the link, but a link to your profile page.** One reason I ask for this is that you can show off your work to employers. To do that, you need to know how to provide a link to your profile page. This alone, of course, won't get you a job. But it has some value, and can be useful in a job interview.

Proposed weekly progress:

| Section     | Percent     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Part 1 | 25% |
| Part 2 | 50% |
| Part 3 | 75% |
| Part 4 | 100% |

**NOTE**: _You can see an icon or a picture of yourself in the upper right hand corner of the Code Academy site. Click that picture, there you will find a way to get your profile page._
