# Web Socket


To create a program that uses the **socket.io** library, follow the directions [here](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/web/JavaScript/Sockets.html).

## Turn it in

When you complete the application, check it into your repository by placing it in a folder called **Week04-WebSocket**.
