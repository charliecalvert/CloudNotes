## Overview

In *Google Drive Files and Folders Part II* we will review how to use Google Drive.

The goal of this assignment is to help students become more familiar with Google Drive and similar tools. Our data belongs in the cloud. There is no other place to put it where we can reach it easily from all our devices. If our data is going to be in the cloud, then we have to be on speaking terms with the tools available in the cloud.

Goals
-----

- Become familiar with working with files and folders in Google Drive
- Learn that a single file and folder can be in more than location on Google Drive

Many cloud services are virtual tools designed to mimic real world objects. We are not actually placing files in folders on a drive. We are working with virtual folders, and virtual drives. Hence we can do things that are not easy to do on a normal file system. For instance, we can make files and folders appear to be in two locations. (Linux actually makes this trick fairly easy. It can also be done in Windows, but there are caveats on a Windows OS that make it such links less than completely useful.)

Details
-------

Here's the assignment:

1. Create a folder inside our shared folder.
1. Call it **GoogleDriveAndFoldersPart02**. And be sure to put it inside the Google Drive folder you have already shared with me.
2. Create a Google Document and put these bullet points inside it. (Just a block copy.)
3. Name the Document BulletPoints.
4. Create two folders called Folder01 and Folder02.
5. The document should go in these folders: **GoogleDriveAndFoldersPart02** and **GoogleDriveAndFoldersPart02/Folder01**.
6. You should already have at least three images in your shared folder (2016-prog270-lastname). If you do not have them, create them and put them anyplace else but in **GoogleDriveAndFoldersPart02**.
7. In Folder02 create links (Shift+Z) to at least three images. The images will be somewhere else in shared folders, the links in Folder02.

```
  *2016-prog270-lastname
    * SOME FOLDER OUT HERE SOMEWHERE OR IN ROOT OF OUR SHARED FOLDER
        Img01 // Will likely have some other name, the point is its an image
        Img02 // Will likely have some other name, the point is its an image
        Img03 // Will likely have some other name, the point is its an image
    * GoogleDriveAndFoldersPart02
        BulletPoints
        * Folder01
            BulletPoints // Links to file in GoogleDriveAndFolderPart02
        * Folder02
            Img01 // This link Will likely have some other name, the point is its an image
            Img02 // This link Will likely have some other name, the point is its an image
            Img03 // This link Will likely have some other name, the point is its an image
```

It is important to understand there should be only one instance of **BulletPoints**, and your images. Don't copy them, link to them.

To place a document in one folder, simply navigate to that folder and create the document inside it. To move it from one folder to another, put a check mark in front of the file or folder, then click the **Move To** icon, which is shaped like a folder, and which is located near the top of Google Drive window. But we don't want to move a file, we want to link to it, we want it to appear to be in two places at once. Do this with **Shift-Z**.

**NOTE**: _To have a file appear in multiple places, you should select the file and then type **Shift+Z** and click the **add** button. This will allow you to link to one file from multiple places._

**NOTE**: *To see where a file is located, choose the file, click the **Information Button | Details | Location**.*

## Turn it In

When you are done with the assignment, simply submit the URL of your Google Drive or submit almost anything that lets me know you have completed your work. I can then find your files and folders and check that you have completed the assignment correctly.

Be sure you are meeting he basic requirements of the assignment, which are:

1) To create a document called BulletPoints
2) Create folders and put documents in them
3) Have BulletPoints and images appear in multiple folders.
