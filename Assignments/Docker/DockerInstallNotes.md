Docker is also free, but the licensing is a bit murkier. For Linux, it is clearly free and open source. For Windows, there are questions, and perhaps only a lawyer can sort it out for us. I will try to learn more, but for now, I don't have the expertise to make a ruling.


Here is a quote that says explicitly that Docker CE, the one I want is free:


"Docker Engine has been renamed to Docker Community Edition, and, as the name suggests, it’s a do-it-yourself, community supported version of Docker that’s available for free of cost."


I found that quote here:


https://www.cio.com/article/3176713/open-source-tools/docker-draws-distinctions-between-enterprise-and-community-editions.html


More specifically, it is released under the Apache version 2 license:


https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0


A key line is this license is here:


Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.


A link showing that Docker CE uses this license is here:


https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/blob/master/components/cli/LICENSE


Here is the download page for Docker for Windows showing that it is free, but note that there are some caveats which give me pause:
