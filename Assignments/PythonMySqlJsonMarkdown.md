## Overview

The goal of the Python MySql assignment is to add database support to our program. Here are the major steps invovled:

- Set up Apache Python CGI scripts
- Set up MySQL database and table
- Use a python script to insert data in the database
- Access the data from one of your MakeHtml markdown files

## Some notes

CGI files are server (for now), from:

- /usr/lib/cgi-bin

They will be owned by root, so be prepared to use **sudo** as needed.

You will not need them, but the configuration files for Apache are here:

- /etc/apache2

## Step One

Check to ensure Lamp and MySQL are installed. You know how to do this already. If they are not installed, then [install them][lamp-server].

Check the status of Apache CGI. Specifically, you will probably need to turn on CGI in order to access python server side scripts from your HTML code:

```
sudo a2enmod cgi
```

This command will return one of two values:

1. Enabling module cgi
2. Module cgi already enabled

If you get the first response, then do this:

```
service apache2 restart
```

On EC2, I needed to use sudo:

```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

Once CGI is enabled, then it should stay enabled. You normally don't need to repeat this operation.

Install pip3 and pymysql. We will want these to access MySQL from a Python script:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install pymysql
```

If you get a long error message about ownership try this instead:

```
sudo -H pip3 install pymysql
```

And this might be useful later:

```
sudo python3 -m pip install pymongo
```

Again, you need only install **pip** and **pymsql** once. Once they are installed, they should stay installed.

## Step Two

Create a simple test script to make sure Python CGI is working.

Create a simple python test script in **/usr/lig/cgi-bin**. Open a blank file called **simple.py** in the **cgi** directory with the **nano** editor.


```
sudo nano /usr/lib/cgi-bin/simple.py
```

Files with a **.py** are python scripts.

Paste this python script into the editor:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import cgi
import cgitb
cgitb.enable()  # debug

print("Content-type: text/html;charset=utf-8")
print()

print("""
<html>

<head><title>Prog270 CGI Script</title></head>

<body>

  <h1> This is the Header </h1>

</body>

</html>
""")
```

Set executable permissions on the script:

```
sudo chmod 755 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/simple.py
```

Test the script by going to this url:

- [http://localhost/cgi-bin/simple.py](http://localhost/cgi-bin/simple.py)

## MySQL

Start my SQL. You will prompted for the password you entered when you installed lamp:

```
mysql -u root -p
```

If you lost your password see the first link below. The second is an FYI:

- <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MysqlPasswordReset>
- [Server Guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/mysql.html)
- [Elvenware Passwords](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/database/mysql/linux-user-password.html)

Once you have loaded the mysql client, create a database called **prog270**:

```sql
create database prog270;
use prog270;
```

More info is found here:

- [Elvenware, Create Database](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/database/mysql/MySql.html#createdatabase)

Create a simple table:

```sql
create table presidents (id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, first varchar(128), last varchar(128), PRIMARY KEY (id));
```

Insert some data in the table:

```sql
insert into presidents (first, last) values ('George', 'Washington');
insert into presidents (first, last) values ('John', 'Adams');
insert into presidents (first, last) values ('Thomas', 'Jefferson');
```

Make sure that life is good:

```sql
select * from presidents;
mysql> select * from presidents;
+----+--------+------------+
| id | first  | last       |
+----+--------+------------+
|  1 | George | Washington |
|  2 | John   | Adams      |
|  3 | Thomas | Jefferson  |
+----+--------+------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Type the following to exit mysql:

```
exit;
```

## Python Script

Put this in '/usr/lib/cgi-bin' as **get-presidents.py**:

```python
#! /usr/bin/python3

import cgitb
cgitb.enable()

import pymysql
import json

print("Content-Type: text/json")
print()

conn = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', user='root', passwd='foobar', db='prog270')

cursor = conn.cursor()

cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM presidents")

rows = cursor.fetchall()

print(json.dumps(rows));

cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

After you paste in the file, you will probably need to change the password in the **pymysql.connect** statement.

You might want to use this command:

```
sudo nano /usr/lib/cgi-bin/get-presidents.py
```

When you are done:

```
sudo chmod 755 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/get-presidents.py
```

## Problem

At one point, I found that my script worked at the command line, but not in the browser. In particular, I got an error with **import pymsql**. It turned out that I had installed **pymysql** without sudo, so it ended up in my home directory. To fix this, you may need to uninstall from your home directory and reinstall as sudo:

<pre>
sudo pip3 uninstall pymysql
sudo -H pip3 install pymysql
</pre>

Check to see what packages are installed for a particular version of Python:

<pre>
$ ls /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/
pip  pip-8.1.2.dist-info  pymysql  PyMySQL-0.7.9.dist-info
</pre>

## Show Data

Paste some HTML into a markdown file called **AllTest/presidents.md**:

```html
<div>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" id="getPresidents" type="button"> Get Presidents </button>
</div>

<div>
  <ul id='bar'>
  </ul>
</div>
```

Open up **/var/www/html/js/elven-help.js** and edit it until you get something like the following:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
	$('table').addClass('table table-striped table-hover');

	$('#getPresidents').click(getPresidents);

	function getPresidents() {
		$.getJSON('/cgi-bin/get-presidents.py', function(presidents) {
			presidents.forEach(function(president) {
				$('#bar').append('<li>' + president[1] + ' ' + president[2] + '</li>');
			});
		})
	}
});
```

Click the button to see the names of the first three presidents. The button click sends a command to the server which queries the database and sends data back in JSON format.

## Turn it in

Copy any new markdown, including **presidents.md** into your repository. It should end up in your **prog270-lastname-2016/AllTest** directory.

Copy the updated **elven-help.js** file and any other updated files into your **prog270-lastname-2016/ApacheHelpers** directory or subdirectories.

**NOTE**: _You should be using the scripts from [ApacheHtml][aphtml] assignment to aid with this process._

Push your repository. Switch to EC2, pull your repository, copy the new files out to **~/Documents/AllTest** and **/var/www/html** or their subdirectories, as appropriate.

On EC2, complete the steps found above in the [MYSQL](#MySQL) section.

Run MakeHtml. Take screenshots of your page running both on localhost and on EC2. Put them in our shared Google Drive folder in a folder called **PythonMySQlJson**.

On the text page of Canvas, include live links to your page on EC2 and to your new Google Drive folder. Don't put the links in a comment. I want to be able to click them and be taken directly to your work.

## Optional Setup cgi dir

This seems to be working for me now. The goal is to use **/var/www/cgi** as your CGI directory in addition to **/usr/lib/cgi-bin**.

Make sure the CGI directory exists:

```
cd /var/www
sudo mkdir cgi
sudo chown -R bcuser:bcuser cgi
```

Create a simple python test script in **/var/www/cgi**. Open a blank file called **simple.py** in the **cgi** directory. Files with a **.py** are python scripts.


```
cd /var/www/cgi
nano simple.py
```

Now edit **serve-cgi-bin.conf**:

```
cd /etc/apache2/conf-available
sudo nano serve-cgi-bin.conf
```

 Near the end add the following:

```text
<IfDefine ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN>
        ScriptAlias /cgi/ /var/www/cgi/
        <Directory "/var/www/cgi">
                AllowOverride None
                Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
                Require all granted
        </Directory>
</IfDefine>
```

It might be simplest if I just give you my entire file:

```text
<IfModule mod_alias.c>
	<IfModule mod_cgi.c>
		Define ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN
	</IfModule>

	<IfModule mod_cgid.c>
		Define ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN
	</IfModule>

	<IfDefine ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN>
		ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
		<Directory "/usr/lib/cgi-bin">
			AllowOverride None
			Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
			Require all granted
		</Directory>
	</IfDefine>
	<IfDefine ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN>
    ScriptAlias /cgi/ /var/www/cgi/
    <Directory "/var/www/cgi">
      AllowOverride None
      Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
      Require all granted
    </Directory>
  </IfDefine>
</IfModule>
```
