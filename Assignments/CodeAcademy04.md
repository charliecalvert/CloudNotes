# Code Academy Part IV

Bring the JavaScript and HTML courses to 50%.

- [Learn JavaScript][ijs]
- [Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

When you have reached 100%, submit a link to your Code Academy **profile page**, like this:

- <http://www.codecademy.com/netslayer43536>

Remember, not just any page for the link when you reach 100%, but **a link to your profile page**. One reason I ask for this is that you can show off your work to employers. To do that, you need to know how to provide a link to your profile page. This alone, of course, won't get you a job. But it has some value, and can be useful in a job interview. If you have not yet reached 100%, then send a screenshot.

Proposed weekly progress:

- Part 1:  12.5%
- Part 2:  25%
- Part 3:  37.5%
- Part 4:  50%
- Part 5:  62.5%
- Part 6:  75%
- Part 7:  87.5%
- Part 8:  100%

**NOTE**: _You can see an icon or a picture of yourself in the upper right hand corner of the Code Academy site. Click that picture, there you will find a way to get your profile page._

## Turn it in

Remember, your progress in Code Academy can be used in a job application, a web profile, a resume, etc. But to be able to present the material the right way, you need to be able to provide prospective employers with a proper link to your profile. It's the official way to show your progress, and I want to be sure you know how to use it. Please provide your profile link when submitting this assignment.
