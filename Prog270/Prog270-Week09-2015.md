Week09
======

In Class
--------

- [Back to CloudNotes TOC](../CloudNotes.html)
- [Today's Deck](http://bit.ly/1bZyGGB)

###In Class Assignment

Boot your mobile device and

- Sign in to the mobile device you are given as class starts
- Install Google Drive, Google+, Twitter, Evernote and optionally DropBox
- Take screen shots of your work in all the apps as described below
- Take a screenshot of your Settings | Accounts page.
- Put the screen shots in your folder on Google Drive

When you are done, submit a link to your folder.

####Your Google Account

An Android device is fairly powerful in and of itself,
but the real strength of the device becomes apparent
once you have logged on to your Google account.

####Google Drive

You can edit documents on your google device. Provide
a screen shot of you editing a document from your Prog270
Google Drive folder on your mobile device.

####Twitter

Create tweet on your mobile device, and take a picture
of the screen just before you submit it.

####Evernote

While on your mobile device, create a note in Evernote
and take screen shot of it while you are editing it.

####Google+

Make a post in Google+ and provide a screen shot of 
your work in Google+

####Upload Screenshots

You can **share** the screen shots you created to
both Google Drive and DropBox. It may take a moment
for you to figure out how to **share** a photo, but
if you look in the menu system, you will see that
the option is available.

###Misc

Online
------

Here is where you can find assignments and content 
that you can explore at home, outside of class.

###Watch Videos

There will be several videos showing how to use mobile
devices. The first one is here:

- [Android and Google Documents](http://youtu.be/uHCpLgpk4T0)

Details on this assignment to follow.

###Bootstrap

Check the due date of this assignment in Canvas.

- [Assignment page](https://bc.instructure.com/courses/834458/assignments/3016277)

Create a Bootstrap document that uses the images you
created in class. Include text that describes each of 
the images.

Include your bitmaps of working in our Android Asus Memo Device  in 
this project and check it in. I want you to link to your files 
stored in Google Drive directly. If you create a public folder in 
Google Drive, then you can put your images there and reference them 
in your HTML.

Here is a sample URL:

	<img src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B1pGBKYyP0gdZ2owNTV3SjdlU00/ScreenShot01.jpg" alt="ScreenShot01.jpg" />

If you go to Google Docs, and you choose to share your folder, you can retrieve
the URL for the folder. It looks like this:

	https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1pGBKYyP0gdZ2owNTV3SjdlU00&usp=sharing

Notie that the ID shown here is the next to last field of the URL for
the screenshot:

	https://googledrive.com/host/ID OF DRIVE/ScreenShotName.jpg

<p>And here is an actual image:</p>

![Image from Google Drive](https://googledrive.com/host/0B1pGBKYyP0gdZ2owNTV3SjdlU00/ScreenShot01.jpg)

Download the starter source which is linked from the in Canvas. There
is an updated copy of the source available, but
it differs from the first version in only very small ways. In 
particular, the menu for the two supplimental pages has been
updated to match the menu on the first page.</p>

[Assignment page](https://bc.instructure.com/courses/834458/assignments/3016277) 

####The Home Page

At the top of the home page, you should create a table or list showing
the key features of our Android device. List, for instance, the:

- Amount of memory it has on the hard drive
- The amount of RAM it has
- Which processor it uses
- The size of the screen
- The version of Android that it runs
- Other details such as ports and buttons
- The cost, etc.

On the home page, notice that there are three bitmaps arranged in a
simple pattern:

```
   [Pix1]
[Pix2] 
   [Pix3]
```

You should preserve this pattern in your version of the app. I have 
placed a screen shot of our Android device in Pix1. You should put 
pictures of your Android in positions for Pix2 and Pix3, which are 
shown below in green and blue. Whether you replace Pix1 with one of 
your own is up to you.

![Alternate Images](../Images/AndroidPixs01.png)

You should put text describing your pictures next to the pictures
themselves. Which pictures you put where are up to you. However, some
screenshots that would be good candidates for this page would include:

- The WiFi Settings page
- The Applications Page
- The Widgets Page
- The About Tablet | Status Page
- The Google Drive Page
- A SkyDrive Page
- AirDroid

And many more.

There are two more pages in the web application. Right now one is called
**Pictures** and the other **About**. You should put more information
about your Android device on these pages. There need be only one 
picture of the device on each page. You might, for instance, create
two pages similar to these:

- Page 1: The Google Music Player. Describe and show getting music from
the play store and playing it in the music player
- Page 2: Google Books. Describe and show getting books from the play
store and viewing them in Google Books.

Other topics might include Vinio and Overdrive, or any other apps or
features that interest you. Be creative, use your imagination. Or 
just do a good workman like job of describing some feature of the 
Android.


###Edit data on mobile device

Provide a screen shot of you editing data from
your CloudNine Mongo Db app on your mobile device.
