Prog 270 - Week 01
==================

Each week we have one in-class session, and one online session. I will
prepare a single document outlining both activities. For instance,
this document outlines what we will cover this week in class, and online.

- [In Class](#inClass)
- [Online](#online)

This is the only copy of these notes. Occasionally, I will update
these notes during the course of the week. In those cases, I will
make an announcement in Canvas. It is your obligation to look
for those announcements, and to respond to them as appropriate. 
As a result, I would strongly suggest that you make a daily habit
of checking the announcements and discussions in Canvas.

Online {#online}
----------------

When working at home this first week I just want you to spend time 
exploring Canvas, exploring the [Elvenware](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie)
site, and practicing creating documents in Google Drive. 

If you have extra time, I would recommend watching at least some of 
the very lengthy key note for Google IO 2013. It will help you 
understand the culture of one of the largest players in the world of 
mobile devices and cloud computing:
