###Assignment 01: Media Query Video

Watch the following videos. There may be quizzes presented on them
either in class or online:

- [MediaQueries](http://youtu.be/xSiSUKV-GCY)
- [Linux Basics](http://youtu.be/pHIRpHDn7WQ)

The Linux Basics video starts by demonstrating how to log on to AWS.
You can ignore that portion of the video. It is just what goes on at
the command line, beginning about 40 seconds into the video that is 
important.

- [Linux File Basics on Elvenware](http://elvenware.com/charlie/os/linux/LinuxFiles.html)
- [Filezilla](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/SshFtpsPutty.html#filezilla)

Take the quiz.

###Assignment 02: GitIgnore


When working on Cloud9, there are some files that you probably
don't want to check in. These include any files
in the following directories:

	.c9revisions
	node_modules

If you have already checked in these files to your repository, it is
simpler to leave there than to remove them. Nevertheless, you can
ensure that your folders don't get an larger than they are now.

Create a file called .gitignore. That's GITIGNORE with a PERIOD in front
of it: .gitignore.

Create or open the file in your editor. This sounds like a simple 
thing, but on Linux, files that begin with a period are hidden. 
Click on the gear icon from the workspace page in Cloud 9, and 
choose to show hidden files. Now you can see files with names like 
.gitignore. 

![Showing hidden files](../Images/ShowHiddenFiles01.png)

Figure 00: Hidden files. [See full size image](../Images/ShowHiddenFiles01.png)

You can also see the hidden files by typing **ls -la** in the terminal
window.

Inside gitignore add the following two lines:

```
.c9revisions
node_modules
```

The first folder holds backup copies of files you have edited, and
the second holds libraries used by Node. Neither of these directories
needs to be stored on GitHub.

Add and check in your .gitignore file:

```
add .gitignore
commit -m "Adding GitIgnore File"
git push
```

When you are done, submit the URL of your repository.

###Assignment 03: Git Config

When you get a local copy of your GIT repository either on Windows,
VirtualBox, or Cloud Nine, there is a hidden directory called .git
that holds the actually repository, and files that configure the
repository. Read about it here:

- [Git Config on Elvenware](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/Git.html#git-config-file)
- [Git Config on Git SCM](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

I want you to right click on your main folder in Cloud 9. Choose "Show
hidden files." Locate your .git folder. Open it up and open up your
**config** file. Copy the entire contents of the file into the 
clipboard and submit it in the text area for the assignment.

The file I want you to submit should look, vaguely, like this:

```
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 09090
	filemodes = hmmm?
	barefoot = socksMissing
	logallstudenterrors = please
[remote "origin"]
	url = git@github.com:someone/somerepo.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
```

It won't look exactly like that, but at least some of it will 
be quite similar.

###Assignment 04: Bootstrap Revisited

This is essentially the same assignment as last week, only the template
is a bit different. I have also tried to make the assignment a bit 
easier. In week06 I will give you a final with a similar challenge,
but it might be a bit trickier.

This time you can [download](the [download](href="/courses/834458/files/30766727/download?verifier=fW1GlHItzSHWUQIralAyqmNm83uWm0A6FMZVCLga">Week05BootStrap.zip) 
the files on which you base your project.

Features I want you to include:

- Four pictures on main page.
- Your avatar on the about and contacts page
- The buttons don't need to go anywhere
- Two ways to navigate:
	- Home, About, Contacts
	- Dropdown Home, About Contacts
- On the about and contacts page, there should be three columns with 
a small default PNG displayed in them. You should replace all the PNG files 
shown on the About page I give you with your own small bitmaps that you make 
with an [online tool](http://pixlr.com/editor/) or with a tool like 
paint .net or [picassa](http://picasa.google.com/).
- Also replace the text in the columns, putting different text on your
your about or contacts page. Your contacts page does not have to include
real contact information.

If you need some inspiration, check out various about and contacts pages
found around the web. Here are googles:

- <https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/>
- <https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/company/facts/management/>

The server.js file included in the project that you can download 
here or from the main assignment page should now be able to handle 
arbitrary CSS, PNG or HTML files. It just looks for the extension, 
and then loads them based on that information. This means you don't 
need to worry so much about the names of your files. Here is the
script, which is also included in the [download](href="/courses/834458/files/30766727/download?verifier=fW1GlHItzSHWUQIralAyqmNm83uWm0A6FMZVCLga">Week05BootStrap.zip):

```
var http = require('http');
var url = require('url');
var port = process.env.PORT || 30025;
var fs = require('fs');

function getPath(request) {
	return url.parse(request.url).pathname;
}

// Thanks to Wallace: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1203361/253576
function getExtension(fileName) {
	var fileNameArray = fileName.split(".");
	if( fileNameArray.length === 1 || ( fileNameArray[0] === "" && fileNameArray.length === 2 ) ) {
		return "";
	}
	return fileNameArray.pop().toLowerCase();    
}

function loadContent(request, response) {
	var path = getPath(request);
	console.log("Request for " + path + " received.");
	if (getExtension(path) === 'css') {
		var css = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + path);
		response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/css'});
		response.write(css);
		response.end();
	} else if (getExtension(path) === 'html') {
		var html = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + path);
		response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
		response.write(html);
		response.end();
	} else if (getExtension(path) === 'png') {
		fs.readFile(__dirname + path, "binary", function(err, file) {
			console.log("PNG detected");
			if(err) {
				console.log("Error reading binary file");
				response.writeHeader(500, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
				response.write(err + "\n");
				response.end();
			}
			else{
				console.log("PNG loaded");
				response.writeHeader(200, {"Content-Type": "image/png"});
				response.write(file, "binary");
				response.end();
			}
		});
	} else {
	    var html = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/index.html');
		response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
		response.write(html);
		response.end();
	}
}

http.createServer(loadContent).listen(port);
console.log("Server has started:" + port);
```


Your page should end up looking something like this but with your 
own pictures and text:

![Charlie's Week05 Bootstrap](../Images/Week05Bootstrap01Small.png)

**Figure 01: Charle's Week05 Bootstrap page.** [Click for full size](../Images/Week05Bootstrap01.png)

I have removed the log in section from the original Bootstrap page:

```
   <form class="navbar-form navbar-right">
      <div class="form-group">
        <input type="text" placeholder="Email" class="form-control">
      </div>
      <div class="form-group">
        <input type="password" placeholder="Password" class="form-control">
      </div>
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-success">Sign in</button>
    </form>
```

This would have appeared rightbefore the closing navbar collapse:

	// Optional fake login controls here. 
	</div><!--/.navbar-collapse -->
	
Make sure you update your repository by committing and pushing your 
changes. That might look something like this:

	git add .
	git commit -m "Updates for Week 05 assignment"
	git push

Turn in a link to your updated repository where you have checked in your
code. In your repository, include the markdown that you used as the
basis for your page. Your markdown does not have to look like your
finished page, it just needs the content that you pasted into your
finished page.


You might want to have page open in Markable, Dillinger, 
DaringFireBall or [https://stackedit.io/](https://stackedit.io/). 
You write text on that page that you will need to use in some 
portion of your web page. That would be a three step process:

- Compose the markdown
- Download the HTML
- Paste chunks of the HTML into various portions of your bootstrap assignment

Then when you are done with the assignment, take the contents of the 
markdown page, check it in to GIT, in the same folder with your 
other code. What I'm looking for here is proof that you originally 
wrote the HTML using markdown. Why? Because ultimately markdown is
a great skill to have if you create a lot of HTML.
