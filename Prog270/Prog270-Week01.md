# Prog 270 - Week 01 - Fall - 2017

Each week we have two sessions, on Monday and Wednesday, in N252. I will try to prepare a single document like this one that outlines the main topics covered each week. For instance, this document outlines what we will cover this week in class, and online.

- [Monday](#monday)
- [Wednesday](#Wednesday)

Occasionally, I will update these notes during the course of the week. In those cases, I will usually make an announcement in Canvas. Please look for those announcements, and respond to them as appropriate. I suggest that you make a daily habit of checking the announcements and discussions in Canvas.

Since these documents may change at any time, please view them online rather than printing them. To be sure you are seeing the latest version, refresh the document at least once a day.

**NOTE**: _On many computers, you can refresh a web page by selecting the F5 key._
