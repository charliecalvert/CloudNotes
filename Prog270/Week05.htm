<h3 id="assignment-01-media-query-video">Assignment 01: Media Query Video</h3>
<p>Watch the following videos. There may be quizzes presented on them either in class or online:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/xSiSUKV-GCY">MediaQueries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/pHIRpHDn7WQ">Linux Basics</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Linux Basics video starts by demonstrating how to log on to AWS. You can ignore that portion of the video. It is just what goes on at the command line, beginning about 40 seconds into the video that is important.</p>

<p>Take the quiz.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-02-gitignore">Assignment 02: GitIgnore</h3>
<p>When working on Cloud9, there are some files that you probably don't want to check in. These include any files in the following directories:</p>
<pre><code>.c9revisions
node_modules</code></pre>
<p>If you have already checked in these files to your repository, it is simpler to leave there than to remove them. Nevertheless, you can ensure that your folders don't get an larger than they are now.</p>
<p>Create a file called .gitignore. That's GITIGNORE with a PERIOD in front of it: .gitignore.</p>
<p>Create or open the file in your editor. This sounds like a simple thing, but on Linux, files that begin with a period are hidden. Click on the gear icon from the workspace page in Cloud 9, and choose to show hidden files. Now you can see files with names like .gitignore.</p>

</figure>
<p>Figure 00: Hidden files. <a href="../Images/ShowHiddenFiles01.png">See full size image</a></p>
<p>You can also see the hidden files by typing <strong>ls -la</strong> in the terminal window.</p>
<p>Inside gitignore add the following two lines:</p>
<pre><code>.c9revisions
node_modules</code></pre>
<p>The first folder holds backup copies of files you have edited, and the second holds libraries used by Node. Neither of these directories needs to be stored on GitHub.</p>
<p>Add and check in your .gitignore file:</p>
<pre><code>add .gitignore
commit -m &quot;Adding GitIgnore File&quot;
git push</code></pre>
<p>When you are done, submit the URL of your repository.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-03-git-config">Assignment 03: Git Config</h3>
<p>When you get a local copy of your GIT repository either on Windows, VirtualBox, or Cloud Nine, there is a hidden directory called .git that holds the actually repository, and files that configure the repository. Read about it here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/Git.html#git-config-file">Git Config on Elvenware</a></li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup">Git Config on Git SCM</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I want you to right click on your main folder in Cloud 9. Choose &quot;Show hidden files.&quot; Locate your .git folder. Open it up and open up your <strong>config</strong> file. Copy the entire contents of the file into the clipboard and submit it in the text area for the assignment.</p>
<p>The file I want you to submit should look, vaguely, like this:</p>
<pre><code>[core]
    repositoryformatversion = 09090
    filemodes = hmmm?
    barefoot = socksMissing
    logallstudenterrors = please
[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
    url = git@github.com:someone/somerepo.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch &quot;master&quot;]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/master</code></pre>
<p>It won't look exactly like that, but at least some of it will be quite similar.</p>
<h3 id="assignment-04-bootstrap-revisited">Assignment 04: Bootstrap Revisited</h3>
<p>This is essentially the same assignment as last week, only the template is a bit different. I have also tried to make the assignment a bit easier. In week06 I will give you a final with a similar challenge, but it might be a bit trickier.</p>
<p>This time you can [download](the [download](href=&quot;/courses/834458/files/30766727/download?verifier=fW1GlHItzSHWUQIralAyqmNm83uWm0A6FMZVCLga&quot;&gt;Week05BootStrap.zip) the files on which you base your project.</p>
<p>Features I want you to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four pictures on main page.</li>
<li>Your avatar on the about and contacts page</li>
<li>The buttons don't need to go anywhere</li>
<li>Two ways to navigate:
<ul>
<li>Home, About, Contacts</li>
<li>Dropdown Home, About Contacts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On the about and contacts page, there should be three columns with a small default PNG displayed in them. You should replace all the PNG files shown on the About page I give you with your own small bitmaps that you make with an <a href="http://pixlr.com/editor/">online tool</a> or with a tool like paint .net or <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">picassa</a>.</li>
<li>Also replace the text in the columns, putting different text on your your about or contacts page. Your contacts page does not have to include real contact information.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need some inspiration, check out various about and contacts pages found around the web. Here are googles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/company/facts/management/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/company/facts/management/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The server.js file included in the project that you can download here or from the main assignment page should now be able to handle arbitrary CSS, PNG or HTML files. It just looks for the extension, and then loads them based on that information. This means you don't need to worry so much about the names of your files. Here is the script, which is also included in the [download](href=&quot;/courses/834458/files/30766727/download?verifier=fW1GlHItzSHWUQIralAyqmNm83uWm0A6FMZVCLga&quot;&gt;Week05BootStrap.zip):</p>

<p>Your page should end up looking something like this but with your own pictures and text:</p>

<p><strong>Figure 01: Charle's Week05 Bootstrap page.</strong> <a href="../Images/Week05Bootstrap01.png">Click for full size</a></p>
<p>I have removed the log in section from the original Bootstrap page:</p>
<pre><code>   &lt;form class=&quot;navbar-form navbar-right&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;Email&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;form-group&quot;&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; placeholder=&quot;Password&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-success&quot;&gt;Sign in&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This would have appeared rightbefore the closing navbar collapse:</p>
<pre><code>// Optional fake login controls here. 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--/.navbar-collapse --&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Turn in a link to your repository where you have checked in your code. In your repository, include the markdown that you used as the basis for your page. Your markdown does not have to look like your finished page, it just needs the content that you pasted into your finished page.</p>
<p>You might want to have page open in Markable, Dillinger, DaringFireBall or <a href="https://stackedit.io/">https://stackedit.io/</a>. You write text on that page that you will need to use in some portion of your web page. That would be a three step process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compose the markdown</li>
<li>Download the HTML</li>
<li>Paste chunks of the HTML into various portions of your bootstrap assignment</li>
</ul>
<p>Then when you are done with the assignment, take the contents of the markdown page, check it in to GIT, in the same folder with your other code. What I'm looking for here is proof that you originally wrote the HTML using markdown. Why? Because ultimately markdown is a great skill to have if you create a lot of HTML.</p>
