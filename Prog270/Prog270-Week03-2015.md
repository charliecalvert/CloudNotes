Week 03 Prog 270
================

Overview
--------

This week we are going to focus on Markdown, mobile hardware, and
Google Sites.

In Class
--------

- [Day 05 Deck](http://bit.ly/19xTi5l)
- Take a screenshot
	- Use PNG, JPG or GIF
	- Snipping Tool on Windows 7 and 8
- [Google Site Quiz](GoogleSiteAssignment.html)

Google Site Insert HTML
-----------------------

To insert HTML into a page on Google Sites:

* First put your page in edit mode
* Then go to the top of the page where you have icons for editing your content
* Click the little HTML icon
* Paste in your text and click the Update button.

Markdown Tips
------------

Here is how to put text between images in a markdown document. Notice
that there is an empty line between each of these elements:

Text 1

```
	[Text](ImageURL)
```

Text 2

```
	[Text](ImageURL)
```

Text 3

```
	[Text](ImageURL)
```

Here is an [Example page](https://sites.google.com/site/elvenware/home/prog270/testimagepage).

Here is how to add titles to images in markdown:

	![alt](url "title")

Reference:

This is still not the caption, but when you hover your mouse
over the picture, the "title" will pop up.

Online
------

There will be two assignments this week.

###Assignment 01

We are going to begin serving up our own HTML pages so we can learn
how to craft them to work with mobile devices. To do this, we will use
two technologies:

* Cloud 9 IDE
* NodeJs

When we worked on Google Sites (and we are not done with Google Sites)
we simply checked a button the config page to make our pages work with
mobile sites. In particular, we choose:

* More from the menu
* Manage Site
* Then checked: "Automatically Adjust site to Mobile Phones"

But how is that done? Exactly what makes a page work on a mobile
phone?

A page can "look wrong" on a mobile device in various ways. For
instance, consider this picture:

![Bad Image](../Images/MobileLook01.png)

It doesn't look very nice because the fonts are outsized. Now look
at these pictures:

![Good Image](../Images/MobileLook02.png)

![Good Image](../Images/MobileLook03.png)

Both of these latter images look better than the first picture. In
particular, their fonts are in the right proportion to the page.

It turns out that it is simple to convert a normal HTML page to one
that will work in a mobile browser. At least in some cases it can
be simple. Perhaps not always, but sometimes. For instance, with the
page shown above, all I had to do was add the following code to it:

	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

For now, let's not spend a lot of time thinking about what that code
does on a technical level. It is enough to simply say that it
automatically scales the page to the appropriate size for the phone.
You can think of the **initial-scale** attribute like a "zoom" property.
We are zoomed to level 1, which is normal size for the device.

####Setting up the Page

If we are going to start adding lines of code to our HTML, then we
need to begin having more control over the way a page is rendered
than we can get on Google Sites. This is not a problem with Google
Sites, which obviously solves all of these problems for us
automatically. Rather it is not the right teaching platform for me
to show you more details about the syntax of content displayed on
mobile devices.

One way to solve this problem would be to take you to a place like
Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, I don't want to take that step
quite yet. Instead, I'll ask that you create an account on the online
IDE called [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/signin.html). This site is free to use. Or at
least it is free for the kind of simple project we want to create.

It turns, out however, that the simplest way to create an account on
Cloud 9 is to "sign in" with a [GitHub](https://github.com/)
account. We will be using GitHub quite a bit in this course, but for
now you can just create your GitHub account, and later we will learn
more about that service. So I will ask you first to simply create an
account on GitHub and then do nothing special with it other than use
it to sign in to Cloud 9. So begin by going to GitHub and creating
an account:

- [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

Now go to Cloud 9, and sign in using your GitHub account. If you are
prompted for a user name and password, they are (most likely)
looking for the name and password on your GitHub account. Once
you are logged into Cloud 9 you are now ready to get started with
this core sections of this assignment.

**Warning:** *I've been using [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/signin.html) for a couple
years now. I tried to introduce it into class last year, but it was
still a bit too funky for that scenario. I think, however, that most
of the kinks are now worked out of the core functionality of the
site. You may still find it down from to time, but 85% of the time
you should find it up and running. Remember: if a site occasionally
has some funkiness, then you probably don't want to wait until 11
PM on the night an assignment is due to begin working with the site.
Rather, start a few days ahead of time, and if occasionally the site
is on the fritz, you can just focus your attention elsewhere for a
few minutes, and then switch back when the site is up and running.
Life in the cloud is less problematic each year, or even each month.
But it is still a bit touch and go at times.*

**Hint:** One trick to consider when using Cloud 9: sometimes the
interface is frozen even though the tools on the site are working
properly. To update the interface, try signing out and signing back
in again. Since you are using GitHub to sign in, you should find
this process very easy.

**HInt: You can check on the [status of Cloud 9](https://status.c9.io/)
to see if there are known problems.

After you sign into Cloud 9, you should go to the DashBoard. On that
page, you should push the large green button labelled "Create New
Workspace."

![Create Workspace](../Images/CloudNine01.png)

When you click the Create Workspace button:

* Name your workspace Prog270-LastName, where LastName is your last name.
* Choose the Hosted solution
* Select the NodeJs button
* Click **Create**

![Start Editing](../Images/CloudNine02.png)

You will have to wait a bit. Perhaps quite a while, as CloudNine is
actually spinning up a virtual machine for you, which is a fairly
costly operation. So give it at least 5, or perhaps 10 minutes, before
giving up. It should work much faster than that, but sometimes things
can be slow if the site has a heavy load. Once your VM is up and
running, it will start much more quickly the next time.

When your Workspace appears to be ready:

* Select your workspace
* Click on the green **Start Editing** button

![Start Editing](../Images/CloudNine03.png)

Now create two files in your workspace:

* An HTML file called **Test01.html** where you will place your
converted Markdown and a bit of extra code. Make sure you write the
file name, and its case, exactly as shown. It should be **Test01.html**,
not **test01.html** or **test01.HTML** or **TeSt01.hTMl** or any other
variation. Just **Test01.html**.
* You will also need a file called **server.js** that will contain
code that I will give you. This file will be created automatically
for your by Cloud Nine.

At the top of Test01.html paste in this code:

```
<html>
     <head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
     </head>
<body>

<!-- Your converted markdown, now in HTML format, will go here -->

</body>
</html>
```

Now go to your favorite markdown editor and create some markdown with
at least two images and one list. Convert the markdown to HTML and
paste it into your HTML document just below the HTML comment and just
above the closing BODY tag:

```
<html>
     <head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
     </head>
<body>

<!-- Your converted markdown, now in HTML format, will go here -->

<p>Here is an example document with some HTML in it. Your HTML will be
more complex than this.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

![Edit HTML](../Images/CloudNine04.png)

- [Full Size Picture](../Images/CloudNine04.png)

Now edit the document called server.js. Replace its content with
the following code:

```
var http = require('http');
var url = require('url');
var port = process.env.C9_PORT || 1337;
var fs = require('fs');

function getPath(request) {
	return url.parse(request.url).pathname;
}

function onRequest(request, response) {
    var pathname = getPath(request);
    console.log("Request for " + pathname + " received.");
    response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
    response.write("Hello World");
    response.end();
}

function first(request, response) {
	var path = getPath(request);
	console.log("Request for " + path + " received.");
	if (path === '/Test01.css') {
		var css = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + path);
		response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/css'});
		response.write(css);
	} else {
	    var html = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/Test01.html');
		response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
		response.write(html);
	}
    response.end();
}

http.createServer(first).listen(port);
console.log("Server has started:" + port);
```

![Edit server.js](../Images/CloudNine05.png)

- [Full Size Picture](../Images/CloudNine05.png)

Now you can press the **Run** button. You should receive a notice
that your page is running on the Web at a URL that looks like this:

```
Your code is running at 'https://prog270-calvert-c9-charliecalvert.c9.io'.
```

Your URL will look a bit different from this, but it should have at least
some elements in common. For instance, it should end with c9.io.

Congratulations! This is a big accomplishment. You have created a real
web site with a page that works in a mobile browser. You handled all
the code yourself, and created the content of your page.

####Turn it in

Use your browser to visit the page that you find in your copy of
Cloud 9. Take a screenshot of the page. Attach the screen shot to
the assignment. If you want, include a picture of your work inside
the Cloud 9 editor. It should be possible to set things up so we
can see your app running on the right of the editor, and your code
on the left side. That would make the best picture to include with
your assignment.

###Assignment Two

[Watch this video on GitHub](http://youtu.be/k7Hr22oj7L0)

Create a simple repo in GitHub called Prog270-LastName where
lastName is your last name. Your repo should contain a README.md
file. Pull your repo to a local machine and add some additional
markdown to your README file. Send me the URL of your repo.
