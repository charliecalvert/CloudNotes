It is time for the midterm. 

Validate your Code
------------------

Go to this address: <http://validator.w3.org/>

Paste in the URL of your index.html page. You should
be able to see errors in your HTML that cloud nine
and other editors won't see. You should ignore errors
about ng-resource or any other attribute that starts
with ng.



###Midterm Part I

Most of this will be the same as before,
only this time it counts for one third of your grade.

You have three tasks:

- Create a bootstrap based set of at least four HTML pages with images that run
on Cloud 9 and Linux.
- On one of the pages add in JavaScript that accesses your Mongo Lab database and JavaScript
that shows an animated image.
- Create a screen shot of your program running on both:
	- Your phone or tablet if you have one
	- In Android X86 running VirtualBox 

If you don't have a phone, you won't lose points for not submitting 
that screen shot. If you can show me it running on your phone,
but can't get VBox and AndroidX86 running, then the phone screen shot
is much better than nothing. Everyone should, however, be able to get
at least AndroidX86 2.3 running somewhere. 

The content of your bootstrap HTML files is up to you. However, I will
be grading you on your ability to create something reasonably coherent.
Here is what I'm looking for. I want to see that you understand how to
use these tools to put information in the cloud that can viewed on a
mobile device. Getting a web page up and running is good, but I want
to see that you have enough control over that page to put real content
and real pictures in it. This means that I want to see at least a 
paragraph or two of text, and some accompanying images.

You could, for instance, have pages built around one of the following
themes:

- An historical event
- A popular star
- A fictional character like Harry Potter, Alice in Wonderland or David Copperfield
- Pictures and descriptions of your favorite place or hobby
- The planets in our solar system

Further details on this test will follow. This is just enough to let you 
understand what will be expected of you.

NOTE: You don't need to actually load Cloud 9 itself in Android X86. 
Sign in to Cloud 9 on your PC. Then run your server in Cloud 9 by 
focusing **Server.js**, and pressing the **Run** button. At the bottom 
of the IDE, there will be a window called Output that says something 
like this:

```
Running Node Process 

Your code is running at 'https://prog270-calvert-c9-charliecalvert.c9.io'.
Important: use 'process.env.PORT' as the port and 'process.env.IP' as the host in your scripts!
```
 
Take the URL that they show. In the example shown above, the URL is:
 
	https://prog270-calvert-c9-charliecalvert.c9.io
 
Take that URL and type it into the Android x86 browser address bar. 
I don't think there is any way to cut and paste. You have to type it 
in manually. After a bit your app should appear in the "mobile' 
browser. The point is to display the output from your HTML code on a 
"mobile device." Trying to do development by loading Cloud 9 itself 
on a mobile device is still not possible, or at any rate practical, 
in most cases.

###Assignment for Week 7

There may be a quiz in which you will be expected to answer some
questions about Android. You will be able to answer the questions
by using your Android X86 emulator.

I will post a link to the quiz when it is ready.
