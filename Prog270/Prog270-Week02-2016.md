Picking a Tablet
----------------

On Tuesday, I would like to dig more into the Android hardware, and 
perhaps that would be the best place to explore in depth.

I want to talk about Android hardware on Tuesday, and probably the 
best idea is to wait for that date. Then I will have time to lay out 
all the options. However, the Nexus/Galaxy/top of the line Asus 
tablets are certainly all good choices in most cases.

------

The primary job this week will be to complete the 
[MarkDown Assignment](https://bc.instructure.com/courses/834458/assignments/2877658).
The assignment itself can be found inside Canvas, and is linked 
from the modules area. On Google Drive I have prepared 
[a document](http://bit.ly/1cm36qb) which
both describes the assignment, and also provides a mini-lecture on
the subject of markdown itself. I have also included a very short, silent
[video](http://youtu.be/YZUruYmEFG0) that will help you get an overview of the concepts you need to 
master to complete the assignment.

#### Some Links

None of these links are particularly important at this moment, but I find
all of them interesting.
