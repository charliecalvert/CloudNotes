Key Assignments:

- [Git Dual Repos][git-dual-repos]

## Markdown {#markdown}

An important task this week will be to complete the [Markdown Basics Assignment][mdbas]. I have also included a very short, outdated, silent [video](http://youtu.be/YZUruYmEFG0) that will help you get an overview of the concepts you need to master to complete the assignment.

You may also find this useful just because it may contain a few tips not found in the real assignment:

- [The old, defunct MarkDown Assignment](http://bit.ly/old-markdown-text).

## Chrome, Firefox and Lastpass Login

There are two services, Chrome and Firefox. We need to be able to log into both browsers.

## Getting Connected

## Picking a Tablet

I know longer have a handle on the tablet market, but it is worth thinking about.

Then I will have time to lay out all the options. However, the Nexus/Galaxy/top of the line Asus tablets are certainly all good choices in most cases. The Kindle fire is interesting choice with both ups and downs.

## Outdated Hint about Virtual Extensions in VirtualBox

You probbly don't need to know this, but if you are curious. Be sure to choose **Settings | System | Acceleration** and confirm that **VT-x | AMD-V** is selected. You can confirm this at run time by selecting **Machine | System Info**. If you don't have virtualization help from the processor then your VM will either be very slow, or not work at all. You turn it on in the BIOS for your computer. The school computers will have it turned on. Your laptop probably has it turned on, but some laptops have it turned off. Almost all modern computers have support for the VT-x or AMD-V. But some, very few, don't. Don't every buy a computer that does not offer this feature.
