In Class

###Amazon Web Services and S3

Information is found here:

- [Today's Deck](http://bit.ly/Rzi2Da)
- [AWS on Elvenware](http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/cloud/WebServices.html#aws)

###DropBox

- Turn on Camera Uploads
- [Referrals, Free Space](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals)
- [Bonus Space](https://www.dropbox.com/account/bonus)

###SkyDrive

- Create documents in Windows
- View them on your device.

Online
------

The final:

- Upload all projects to S3
- Link from your Google Site and submit the URL of the page.
	- Choose the open site on new page option when linking to projects
	
There is a new copy of Week09Android03.zip that contains a working 
version of **SendToS3.js**. You will need to edit config.json to host
your credentials. **SendToS3.js** is designed to run on Windows. You
should run it on Windows like this.

One time only for each project you want to upload enter this command:

	npm install
	
npm  processes a file called package.json.

Next you enter the command to upload the file to S3  

	node SendToS3.js
	
Don't forget to set up your config.json file with your access key!

The three changes you can make:

- On line 7: var config = **AWS.config.loadFromPath('config.json');**
- On line 12. You bucket: **var bucketName = 'prog270.elvenware.com';**
- Optionally, on line 31, the name of your folder: **nameOnS3 = "Week09Android" + nameOnS3;**

Then edit the files that will be uploaded. 

- Don't upload node_modules, config.json or SendToS3.js
- For binary files (images) leave the last parameter as **false**
- List each file that your project needs, including CSS files.

If I can create a copy that works on CloudNine, I will upload it.

- [Download](https://bc.instructure.com/courses/834458/assignments/3016277)

The only changes are the addition of:

- SendToS3.js
- package.json
- config.json

These changes should not effect your existing projects. 

Your credentials are found by:

- Signing into AWS
- Selecting your name in the upper right hand corner
- Going to the **Security Credentials** page.

###Turn It In
When grading your final I will look at:

- Your repository, where I hope to find all your projects and SendToS3 files.
- Your Google Site home page, where I hope to find links to all your
projects on S3
- A page in Google Drive with all your links on it
- A page in SkyDrive with all your links in it
- A page in EverNote with all your links in it

[Example page](https://sites.google.com/site/elvenware/home/prog270)

Submit all your links in the Text page of the Canvas submission page for
the Final. I'm looking for something like this, though if you are 
missing one or two, it is not a big deal:

- Week03 Assignment 01. This should be easy to recreate if you don't still have it.
- Week04 Media Queries
- Week04 BootStrap
- Week05 BootStrap Revisted
- Week06 Animation
- Week07 Midterm
- Week08 Mongo DB
- Week09 Android

If you don't have all the projects, just do the best you can. Remember
to check your submissions in Canvas as that might help you recover lost
files. But in theory, everything is in GitHub.

Don't be too focused on what I want. Focus instead on putting together
something that shows what you have learned this quarter. If you went to
a job interview, what would you want to show to highlight your skills?

###Launching from S3

When you put a project on a S3, you can properly launch it by:

- Locating your index.html file
- Turning to the Properties page
- Clicking the **Link**

- [Full size image](../Images/P270S301.png)

###Your Security Credentials

It is best if you don't check your credentials into GitHub. When you 
turn in your assignment, you have two choices with the config.json 
file:

- Don't turn in your credentials. I will test your code on my
S3 site.
- Paste your credentials into the text field in Canvas when you
turn in the assignment. After Finals (Dec 17 on) you
can change your credentials. 

Probably option 1 is best, but it is up to you. 

###Options on S3

There are buttons to refresh the site and to you can delete "objects"
and "buckets." That is, you can delete files and folders.

You will also see options to upload files. That can work for you, 
but in the end, it is generally more work to do things that way, as 
files are not always automatically made public and the metadata is 
not set up right. At any rate, I will (randomly) test your 
**SendToS3.js** files for each project.

Usually the actions you perform on S3 will execute quickly, but
there will be times when you see a significant delay between the 
time you issue a command the time when it is executed. It may just
be coincidence, but it seems to me like commands a I give with
the AWS-SDK (SendToS3.js) execute more quickly than those I give 
via the interface.
