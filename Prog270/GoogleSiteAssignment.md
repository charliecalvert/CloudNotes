In Class Assignment
-------------------

It is time to start adding some pages to your Google Site. We will use
Markdown and images to create the pages. In this assignment, you will
find some images on WikiMedia Commons, and then write a few words
about the images. When you are done, you should have created a page
on some topic that include a few pictures.

We will do three things:

- Create a page on Google Site called **Prog270Oct08**
- Use markdown in the editor of your choice to create your page.
- Link in some images from either Google++ or WikiMedia.

When you press the submmit button the [assignment](https://bc.instructure.com/courses/834458/assignments/2898435), you will turn 
in two things:

- The URL of the page you created on Google Site
- The markdown that you used to create your page.


Find a file URL from the [WikiMedia Commons](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

When you find the image you want. Get its URL. Go, for instance,
to [this page](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Araguanei.JPG).
Click on the **Use this file on the web** link. Grab the **File URL**.
Embed it in your markdown, using syntax like this:

```
![My Description](MyURL)

For instance:

![Araguanei](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Araguanei.JPG/320px-Araguanei.JPG)
```

It might look like this:

![Araguanei](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Araguanei.JPG/320px-Araguanei.JPG)

![Fossil](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Anomalous_rostrum_of_Hibolithes_jaculoides_%28Swinnerton%2C_1937%29_-_photograph_and_MRI.png)

If the picture is too large, consider using one of the smaller images
linked from the page.

- Optionally share some pictures on Google+
