<h3 id="assignment01">Assignment01</h3>
<p>This week we will focus on two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>VirtualBox and Lubuntu</li>
<li>Adding JavaScript animations to our bootstrap code</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is code that you can use as a starting point:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bc.instructure.com/courses/834458/files/31015248/download?verifier=f80EZR8clAcE9KAa9rgE3eDKjZUWq0ZshHX94RhO">Week06Animation.zip</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Open up <strong>index.html</strong> and add in your HTML as you have done before. Also include two animated bitmaps driven by the included JavaScript code found in <strong>index.js</strong>. Do not use animated GIFs or any other technique to animate your page other than the one in the sample code.</p>
<p>Here are the bitmaps:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/Shapes01.png" alt="Shapes01.png" /><figcaption>Shapes01.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The second is very much like the first, but the colors are different:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../Images/Shapes02.png" alt="Shapes02.png" /><figcaption>Shapes02.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you look at these bitmaps, think of them as three rows of images. The first and second rows each have four images. The program creates an animation by quickly flipping through the four images on the top row, and the first image on the second row.</p>
<p>There are two key lines in <strong>index.html</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&#39;drawHere01&#39; class=&#39;draw-target&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;drawHere02&#39; class=&#39;draw-target&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>These are where the animations are drawn.</p>
<p>There are also four key lines in index.js:</p>
<pre><code>var target01 = $(&#39;#drawHere01&#39;);
var target02 = $(&#39;#drawHere02&#39;);
animate(target01, &#39;Shapes01.png&#39;, true);
animate(target02, &#39;Shapes02.png&#39;, false);   </code></pre>
<p>The first two lines define where the bitmap animations will be drawn. To understand how it works compare these two lines:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&#39;drawHere01&#39; class=&#39;draw-target&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
var target01 = $(&#39;#drawHere01&#39;);</code></pre>
<p>Notice that both lines of code reference <strong>drawHere01</strong>. The code helps us specify that the animation should be drawn in the DIV in <strong>index.html</strong> that has an ID of <strong>drawHere01</strong>.</p>
<p>Now look at the last two lines of code:</p>
<pre><code>animate(target01, &#39;Shapes01.png&#39;, true);
animate(target02, &#39;Shapes02.png&#39;, false);</code></pre>
<p>This code calls a custom method called <strong>animate</strong> that takes three parameters. The first is the location in which to draw, as explained above. The second is the bitmap that contains the image to draw. The last states whether or not there are any more images that you want to have animated. You could have more than just these two lines if you wanted to see more than two animations. Just be sure that only the last of these lines passes in <strong>false</strong> in the third parameter.</p>
<p>And finally there is one line in <strong>index.html</strong> that links in <strong>index.js</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;index.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I have modified <strong>server.js</strong> to know how to server up JavaScript pages such as <strong>index.js</strong>.</p>
<p>Right now you will find the animations only on the <strong>index</strong> page. You need to make the appear on both the <strong>contacts</strong> page and on the <strong>about</strong> page. This means you need to move the DIVs onto those pages, and you also need to link in the JavaScript file called <strong>index.js</strong> on those pages.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the animations appear on all three pages</li>
<li>Add your own HTML from your markdown pages to index.html, about.html and contacts.html. This should be some version of the HTML you have submitted for previous assignments. Typically, it will include at least three links to bitmaps on <strong>index.html</strong>, and a link to your avatar on the <strong>about</strong> and <strong>contacts</strong> page.</li>
<li>Open up <strong>Shapes01.png</strong> and <strong>Shapes02.png</strong> and modify the first five images so your animations look different from the defaults. (Row 1, images 1 through 4, Row 2, Image 1.) A simple minimal modification would be to change the color of the gears. You can usually do that in a single click by using the fill tool, which typically looks like a bucket. For instance, notice that the two images shown above use different colors for the gears. You should, at minimum, change the colors to different shades than those included in the pre-packaged solution.</li>
<li>Check your code into your repository in a folder called <strong>Week06-Animate</strong></li>
<li>Include screenshots of your code running in both Cloud9 and in VirtualBox with Lubuntu</li>
</ul>
<p>When taking your screenshot of Lubuntu, it is probably easiest to do it from Windows. Also, if you take the screenshot that way, I can clearly see that you are using VirtualBox. You may not want to focus the Lubuntu window while you take the screenshot as it will absorb the hot keys many of you use for triggering the screenshot (Alt-PrintScrn).</p>
<p>Submit the URL of your repository. The <a href="https://bc.instructure.com/courses/834458/files/31015248/download?verifier=f80EZR8clAcE9KAa9rgE3eDKjZUWq0ZshHX94RhO">starting code</a> is linked from the assignment in Cloud 9.</p>
<p>Remember to come back and check for updates to this assignment and look for additional assignments of hints.</p>
<p>When you are starting your BootStrap project on Lubuntu, navigate to the directory where you have stored your bootstrap project. Then you need to type something like this at the command line:</p>
<pre><code>nodejs Server.js</code></pre>
<p>The system should reply with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Server has started: 30025</code></pre>
<p>Then open your Lubuntu browser and enter this address:</p>
<pre><code>localhost:30025</code></pre>
<p>Now you should see your program running in the Lubuntu browser.</p>
<h3 id="assignment02-virtualbox-and-android-x86">Assignment02 VirtualBox and Android x86</h3>
<p>Androidx86 is a verion of Android that runs on the intel architecture. We are interested in it because we can run it on VirtualBox.</p>
<p>There are various versions of Androidx86 that mirror the history of Android itself. I have, however, been able to install Androidx86 4.3 in VBox, as shown below.</p>
<figure>

<p>Here is a link to the download:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://android-x86.googlecode.com/files/android-x86-4.3-20130725.iso">Android x86 4.3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the install for 4.3, there does not appear to be a step to create a virtual SD card. Note also that you will probably want to set the kernel 3.x.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing about this install is that it includes the PlayStore. This means that you can install at least some of the Android Apps that might interest you. Not all of them will work, and the experience is more than a bit funky, and yet it is interesting.</p>
<p>The install is a bit tricky. I describe it in some detail here, but you should install <a href="http://android-x86.googlecode.com/files/android-x86-4.3-20130725.iso">Android x86 4.3</a> if possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.elvenware.com/charlie/development/android/Androidx86.shtml#installPart01">Androidx86 Install</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a video:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/LNgkRhsgzIc">Video of Android x86</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to use <strong>Right-Ctrl-I</strong> to capture or free the mouse. This is tricky! (And hard to do over remote desktop connection. Sorry. But you can do the install that way, if not all the configuration.)</p>
<p>Not really related to this assignment, but still you might find these older videos interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/ACj-Y6cZRNg">Video of Ubuntu install</a></li>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/QQ_FyMFzk1s">Video of Guest Additions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When you install Androidx86, the networking should just work. I have notes on Elvenware about how to get the networking up and running on various versions of Androidx86, but with 4.3 it should just work. The best way to tell it is working is to go to the browser and browse to Google.com. Alternatively:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alt-F1</li>
<li>ping www.elvenware.com</li>
<li>Alt-F7</li>
</ul>
<p>If the install fails despite repeated efforts, you can consider falling back to this version:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://android-x86.googlecode.com/files/android-x86-2.3-RC1-eeepc.iso">Android x86 2.3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It nearly always works, but is harder to use and does not include the Play Store. In general, each succeeding version is harder to install than the previous, in that it takes more system resources. This is something Google hopes to remember with Android 4.4, KitKat. My point is that you might try 3.2 or 4.0 if 4.3 fails. But 2.3 should work for nearly everyone.</p>

<p>The big payoff, of course, is getting signed in to your Google Account. Until you do that, Android doesn't really work very well. I find that sometimes Android complains that it is not on the wireless network and so it can't sign you in. If you hit this problem, try opening the browser, going to the Google web site, signing in, and then signing in again. You can sign in on the settings screen, near the bottom:</p>

<p>The red highlight shows where to click to add an account. The blue Google icon shows that I am signed in to my Google Account. Look up at the Green picture of Android shown above. See the six dots in the lower middle of the screen? Click that to get to the Program view. The settings app is near the bottom left.</p>

<p>I realize that some people may have some trouble with this install. If you run across a complete road block, then cease and desist, but be sure to document with screenshots your point of failure and various way points you encountered.</p>
<p>Here is an image from the Settings | Storage screen that shows what my Android virtual hard drive looks like.</p>

<p>When you are done, check in to github one or more screenshots of it either running or not running. Then submit your URL. I will try to monitor the discussion area over the next few days, so feel free to ask questions.</p>
