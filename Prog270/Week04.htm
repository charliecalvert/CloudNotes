<p>Here is where I will place assignments you should complete outside of class time.</p>
<p>Neither of these assignments are complete yet, but the second and third ones now contain enough detail so you can get some work done on them and then come back later to learn additional details.</p>

<p>As you know, Responsive Design is a technique for changing the features of a page via CSS when you change the size of the page. Below is the HTML and CSS source code for a page similar to the one described in the CSS Colors section of Elvenware:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Color Tables by Charlie Calvert&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;ColorTables.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

&lt;header&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Color Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

&lt;article&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is a table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;position01&quot;&gt;Able&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;position02&quot;&gt;Beta&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;position03&quot; style=&quot;width: 50px&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;


&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can save the above HTML as <strong>ColorTables.html</strong>. Here is the CSS for that page, which you should save as <strong>ColorTables.css</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>body {
    background-color: #007700;
    color: #004400;
}

p {
    font-size:large;    
}

header {
    background-color: #00AA00;
    color: #BBFFBB; 
}

article {
    background-color: #00FF00;
    color: #008800;     
}

.position01 {
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    background-color: #BBFFBB;
    font-weight:bold;
}

.position02 {
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    background-color: #88FF88;
    font-weight:bold;
}

.position03 {
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    background-color: #55FF55;
    font-weight:bold;
}</code></pre>
<p>Your goal is to fix the page so that it changes colors as it is resized. In particular, the pages have colors shading from blue when big, green when medium sized and red when small.</p>
<p>The ColorTables page is made up entirely of shades of green. Your job is to create two more sets of colors, one that is shades of red, and the other that is shades of blue. When the Prog270Tables.html page is big, it should be all shades of blue, when it is in medium size it should be all shades of green, and when it is small it should be all shades of red.</p>
<p>You should provide two solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>One that uses media queries to link in three different CSS pages. Use the media queries to select one CSS page for blue shades, one CSS page for green shades, and one CSS page for red shades.</li>
<li>The HTML for your second solution should link to a single CSS page that contains media queries for all three sets of colors.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are finished, name your files Prog270Tables01-LastName.html and Prog270Tables02-LastName.html. Include these pages and their associated CSS files in a zip file called Prog270Tables-LastName.zip, where LastName is your last name.</p>
<p>Feel free to use your creativity on the pages. You can add new content to the pages, but you must keep the table and have it be shades of the same color used on the rest of the page. Even on the green page you need not use the same shades of green that I use.</p>
<p>If you find choosing colors using the #00FF00 type syntax confusing, automate the process by using a tool such as Colorzilla. There you will find a way to automatically generate colors expressed in #00FF00 syntax. (To be clear, I want you to use #00FF00 type syntax, but you can automate the generation of those bits of code using Colorzilla.)</p>

<p>Here is an example of how to combine three different &quot;looks&quot; for a page in a single CSS file. The appearance of the page changes as you resize the browser:</p>
<pre><code>/* Default */
body {
    background-color: #0088FF;
    color: #FFFFFF;
}

/* Medium */
@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {
    body {
        background-color: #00FF00;
        color: #006600;
    }
}

/* Small */
@media screen and (max-width: 520px) {
    body {
        background-color: #FF0000;
        color: #440000;
    }
}   </code></pre>

<p>In particular, you will be interested in this code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&#39;stylesheet&#39; media=&#39;screen and (min-width: 1025px) and (max-width: 2800px)&#39; href=&#39;Large.css&#39; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&#39;stylesheet&#39; media=&#39;screen and (min-width: 701px) and (max-width: 1024px)&#39; href=&#39;Medium.css&#39; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&#39;stylesheet&#39; media=&#39;screen and (min-width: 10px) and (max-width: 700px)&#39; href=&#39;Small.css&#39; /&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="assignment-two-git">Assignment Two: Git</h2>
<p>Go to cloud nine. Click on your existing Prog270-LastName repository and open it up as a workspace. You will see it on the left near the bottom of the Cloud 9 Dashboard, in the section called <strong>Projects on GitHub</strong>. Do your work for this week in that workspace.</p>
<p>Create a folder in your workspace called Week04-Git. Put a README.md file in it that includes a heading and at least once sentence of text.</p>
<p>Check in your work:</p>
<pre><code>git add Week04-Git
git commit -m &quot;This is the second part of my week four assignment&quot;
git push</code></pre>
<p>It is possible that you get an error that contains text similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>To git@github.com:charliecalvert/Simple02.git
 ! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (fetch first)
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., &#39;git pull ...&#39;) before pushing again.</code></pre>
<p>Clearly they are asking that you do a <strong>git pull</strong>, and then try once again to push. In that case, the code you see might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Src\Git\Simple02&gt;git pull

<p>To turn in this assignment, simply submit the URL of your repository.</p>
<p>For the next part of this assignment, you should create a folder called Week04-Bootstrap01. Use that folder for the work you do for Assignment Three.</p>
<p>You should work in the Prog270-LastName folder, and have both the Week04-Git and Week04-Bootstrap folders directly inside it. That should end up looking like this:</p>
<pre><code>Prog270-LastName
--- Week04-Git
--- Week04-Bootstrap.</code></pre>
<p>See below for some notes on working with files and directories in Git.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-three-bootstrap-part-i">Assignment Three: Bootstrap Part I</h2>
<p>Bootstrap is a library created by Twitter that is designed to make it easy for your to create nice looking web pages that automatically work on three screens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop</li>
<li>Tablet</li>
<li>Phone</li>
</ul>
<p>The first bootstrap Assignment is like the first Cloud Nine assignment: You will create some markdown, convert it to HTML paste it into an existing HTML file, and run it via Node on Cloud 9. This time, however, you will be linking in the bootstrap CSS and JavaScript that will give your page a special look that works well on multiple platforms. Consider just adding your code to a new directory in the GitHub repository you have been using.</p>
<p>We are going to begin working with Starter Bootstrap Template which is found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/starter-template/">http://getbootstrap.com/examples/starter-template/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you right click on that page, and choose &quot;Show Source,&quot; you can find the the <a href="view-source:http://getbootstrap.com/examples/starter-template/">source code for the page</a>.</p>
<p>It consists of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The header</li>
<li>The body Part I</li>
<li>The body Part II</li>
</ul>
<p>I want you to create a page similar to this boilerplate starter page. The page you create should be called index.html, and it should be hosted on cloud 9 and placed in your repository.</p>
<p>I have modified the bootstrap boilerplate code somewhat to make it easier for you to use. In particular, I have linked in CDN versions of the bootstrap CSS and JavaScript, as this help your page load faster it would if you used your own version. This also frees you up from having to download and install a local version of these pages.</p>
<p>I should add that a CDN is a server that caches copies of key libraries that are used by many developers. In our case, the bootstrap JavaScript library file, and its accompanying CSS are hosted on a CDN site. The one disadvantage of using a CDN, of course, is that you must be connected to the Internet to use these pages.</p>
<p>Here is my version of the header:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Elven Bootstrap01&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;link rel=&quot;shortcut icon&quot; href=&quot;favicon.png&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS --&gt;
        &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!-- Optional theme --&gt;
        &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css&quot;&gt;
        &lt;link href=&quot;index.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript --&gt;
        &lt;script src=&quot;//code.jquery.com/jquery.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src=&quot;//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I have included all the library code you need to get your bootstrap page up and running. Note that I have referenced both <strong>jquery</strong> and <strong>bootstrap.min.js</strong>. This means that you can omit the two lines found at the bottom of the boilerplate Starter Page that bootstrap provides. These are the links that begin with a <strong>script</strong> tag and contains the words assets, dist, jquery and bootstrap. I link all that in above so don't include it in your code. I will show you what to link in, so there should be no confusion.</p>
<p>Notice also that the header shown above referencess two files that you must create:</p>
<ul>
<li>favicon.png</li>
<li>index.css</li>
</ul>
<p>The favicon.png image file is 32 X 32 pixels in size. To help you understand what you need to create, here is my favicon file:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="../Images/favicon.png" alt="favicon" style="width: 32px" /></li>
</ul>
<p>You can create this file in the Paint program that comes with Windows. However, I suggest downloading and installing the free Paint.NET program if that option is available to you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://download.cnet.com/Paint-NET/3000-2192_4-10338146.html">Paint.NET from CNET</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The key point is that you must make a PNG file that is 32 X 32 pixels in size.</p>
<p>The second file you will need to create is called index.css. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>body {
    padding-top: 50px;
}

.starter-template {
    padding: 40px 15px;
    text-align: left;
}

pre {
    width: 200px;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just create a file with those contents and save it as <strong>index.css</strong>. Here is what it does:</p>
<ul>
<li>The body tag at the top ensures that there is a gap of 50 pixels at the top of the body where the menu can be placed</li>
<li>The starter templates creates a little padding at the top and right, and then aligns the text to the left. Note that the CSS provided by the bootstrap site aligns the text in the center. That will not work for us, because the pages we are creating with our markdown are designed to be flushed to the left. (Text is flush left by default, of course, but I including an explicit reference here so that you can understand why our code looks different from the bootstrap boilerplate.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I have set the pre tag to have a width of 200px. This is actually specific to my page. As you recall, my default markdown has a little poem in it about a frog and his pond. It is not a very wide poem, so limit the size of the HTML element that contains it. This may have no effect on your code, or it may be the wrong effect. You can play with this setting if necessary. In fact, you can play with any of the CSS if you want.</p>
<p>Ok, we are done with the head. Beneath this you should place the body and closing HTML tag:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;!-- Place the two body elements here. --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now I will describe the code that goes beneath the comment in the body. Here is the first part of the body:</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;div class=&quot;navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;navbar-header&quot;&gt;
          &lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;navbar-toggle&quot; data-toggle=&quot;collapse&quot; data-target=&quot;.navbar-collapse&quot;&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;icon-bar&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;icon-bar&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;icon-bar&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/button&gt;
          &lt;a class=&quot;navbar-brand&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Project name&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;collapse navbar-collapse&quot;&gt;
          &lt;ul class=&quot;nav navbar-nav&quot;&gt;
            &lt;li class=&quot;active&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#contact&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--/.nav-collapse --&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For now, you can leave this alone, but you will need to edit it later. In particular, the links contain an href we will need to be edit.</p>
<p>Here is the second part of the body:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;starter-template&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!-- Place your converted markdown here --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /.container --&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, this code features a container, and inside that container is a place to put your converted markdown. The two class attributes shown here are included so that bootstrap will know how to &quot;style&quot; your page. In particular, note that you know how the starter-template style will look, since we defined it in <strong>index.css</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you have your page up and running, the next step is to get the menu working correctly. There are several ways to solve this problem, some of which are more sophisticated than the one I want you to implement. However, there are advantages to the &quot;simple&quot; solution I show here.</p>
<p>We are going to focus on these lines of codes from the first part of the header:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;li class=&quot;active&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#contact&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The following code is called an anchor, and puts a hyperlink in your page:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>a</strong> in the tag stands for anchor. That is the name of the tag. The <strong>href</strong> attribute is a link to a place in the current document or to another page. For instance, if your web site had a page in it called <strong>MyPage.html</strong>, then you would create a hyperlink to that page with this code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;MyPage.html&quot;&gt;MyPage&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Your job is to create two pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>About.html</li>
<li>Contacts.html</li>
</ul>
<p>They should look more or less exactly like index.html, only they should contain content appropriate to an About and Contact page. You need not include real information on these pages, and in particular, you should not include your email addresses, as SPAM bots can get hold of them. It might be nice, however, to link to your Google Site.</p>
<p>After you create these pages, you should modify your hyperlinks so that clicking on the About link takes you to the about page, and etc. Don't forget to link back to your home page (index.html) from the appropriate link!</p>
<p>You will also need to make similar changes to the Project name link, but I will leave that as an exersize for you.</p>
<p>Your server.js is now going to look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>var http = require(&#39;http&#39;);
var url = require(&#39;url&#39;);
var port = process.env.C9_PORT || 1337;
var fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);

function getPath(request) {
    return url.parse(request.url).pathname;
}

function onRequest(request, response) {
    var pathname = getPath(request);
    console.log(&quot;Request for &quot; + pathname + &quot; received.&quot;);
    response.writeHead(200, {&quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;text/plain&quot;});
    response.write(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
    response.end();
}

function first(request, response) {
    var path = getPath(request);
    console.log(&quot;Request for &quot; + path + &quot; received.&quot;);
    if (path === &#39;/index.css&#39;) {
        var css = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + path);
        response.writeHead(200, {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/css&#39;});
        response.write(css);
    } if (path === &#39;/About.html&#39;) {
        var css = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + path);
        response.writeHead(200, {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/html&#39;, &#39;Content-Length&#39;: &#39;1877&#39;});
        response.write(css);
    } if (path === &#39;/Contacts.html&#39;) {
        var css = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + path);
        response.writeHead(200, {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/html&#39;, &#39;Content-Length&#39;: &#39;1968&#39;});
        response.write(css);
    } else {
        var html = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + &#39;/index.html&#39;);
        response.writeHead(200, {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;text/html&#39;});
        response.write(html);
    }
    response.end();
}

http.createServer(first).listen(port);
console.log(&quot;Server has started:&quot; + port);</code></pre>
<p>Notice the lines called <strong>Content-Length</strong> and are set to values like 1877? You might need to change these to reflect the size your page. You can see the page size by going to the appropriate directory in the terminal and issuing the ls -la. It creates output like this:</p>
<pre><code>charliecalvert@Test02:~/196291/Bootstrap01 (master) $ ls -la

<p>You can see that Contacts.html has a size of 1968 bytes. (I was surprised to see that I needed to include this information in the header, but it fixed a bug when I included it. I'll try to get more information by class time.)</p>
<p>When you are done, do one of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add your code to your GitHub repository, and submit a link to your repository.</li>
<li>Add your code to zip file, and submit the zip file.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="working-with-files-and-directories-in-git">Working with Files and Directories in Git</h2>
<p>Once you have made an add and/or commit in Git, then you should use Git to do things like delete or rename files. If you want to rename a directory from BootStrap01 to Week04-Bootstrap, then do it like this:</p>
<pre><code>git mv BootStrap01 Week04BootStrap</code></pre>
<p>That's git, followed by the mv (move) command.</p>
<p>To delete a file that you have checked in, do this:</p>
<pre><code>git rm MyFile.js</code></pre>
<p>To complete deleted a directory and its contents, do this:</p>
<pre><code>git rm -r MyDirectory</code></pre>
<p>If you have not yet committed your work into Git then you don't need to call file manipulation commands through git. Instead you can just issue the command directly. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>rm MyFile.js</code></pre>
<p>But once you commit your work, then you need to tell Git that you want to delete or rename a file. Then you use the commands shown above.</p>
<p>If you want to do your work on your Windows machine, you can first install Node, then do your work on your home machine, then commit your work to GitHub, then check it out of Git on Cloud 9 and test your code to confirm that it works. To run the server.js from the command line in Windows after installing Node, do this:</p>
<pre><code>node server.js</code></pre>
<p>Remember that after you install Node, node won't be on the path of any Command windows that were open during the install. You have to close those command prompts, then reopen, then they should be able to find Node:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Src\Git\Simple02&gt;node --version
v0.10.20</code></pre>
