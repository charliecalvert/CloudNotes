## Code Academy Assignments

Generally, I provide a link from Canvas to this section of the document. Use the title of the Canvas assignment to find the right link in the list below. For instance, it should be easy to see that the Canvas Assignment with the title **React Code Academy Two Part I** is associated with link below labeled **React Code Academy Two Part 1**. If in doubt, ask a question in the discussion area.

## Weekly Overviews

The overviews are usually not current until the actual week that they cover. In other words, during Week02 of the course, the Week03 overview may be set to the material covered during the previous year. I often don't update the overviews until the actual week when the material in question is being taught.
