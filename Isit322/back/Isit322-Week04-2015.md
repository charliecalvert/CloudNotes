## WebStorm Upgrade

WebStorm has been upgraded to 9.03\. See if you can upgrade with help menu, else download, unzip and replace the folder in ~/bin/webstorm with your new content. That is, close WebStorm, delete /bin/webstorm, then copy the new folder over to the bin directory and name itÂ **webstorm.**
