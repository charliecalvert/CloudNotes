## Books 24X7

When using these links, most folks have a little trouble signing in. But once you are signed in, you can easily use the links. The best strategy I can find is to sign in first to the library and mybcc, then try the links below. So try [logging in to the library][liblog] in a new tab. Now, also sign in to [MyBcc][MyBcc] in a new tab. Once you are logged in to both places, try going here, again right clicking and opening the link in a new tab: [first sign in to 24X7 books][BC247]. If all that works, you should be able to click the links below and be taken directly to the individual books.

Stats on the Cloud

I'm not an analyst or statistician, and have no real passion for these
types of numbers. Still, they do make interesting reading and help
us understand broad trends.
